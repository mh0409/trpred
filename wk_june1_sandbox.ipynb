       "  'selftext': \" Before 11 ago at faculty, I met a girl at economics class, She was a cute girl and I was a loser. I was studying mechanical engineering and she was studying architecture. We had a common taste for example metal music bla bla. I fall in love with her and after a while I told this, I was rejected. Over years I didn't forget her. I tried to stalk her but she wasnot using social media. Whatever. Before 1 or 2 years ago I found her profile in a design application and I began to follow her. I think she was not using that profile so that it took 2 years for her to see me again. Finally 11 years past from my rejection and before 3 days she sent me a message at that design app, then she sent me her whatsapp, we texted 15-20 minutes or more on whatsapp and that is all. What should I do? I think I still love her. How should I treat her? Should I become silent? Do I have to hate her or like her?\\n\\nl want to give more detail nowl am working in a good company for years. She told me that she graduated after 9 years she failed many time and she couldnt find a job so that she continue at post graduate....\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Well gents.\\n\\nCame here to share a story. \\n\\nAnd probably leave it as a cautionary tale to any newcomers that might be shrugging the redpill off as \"mysoginistic bullshit\", as I\\'ve seen some do, or just thinking that it\\'s mainly correct, but that you can do without it,as I did. \\n\\nLet me recap. About 2 years ago, I was in a failed 6 yr ltr, where I got beta\\'d so hard I couldnt even see.\\n\\nI discovered the trp, started doing some reading, and figured \"wait a minute, this is how I used to be\".\\n\\n I was pretty much a huge asshole, to be honest, I didnt even think about it, and it always seemed to work.\\n\\nI asked, on the main sub, and basically, everyone (rightly) called me a faggot when I said I was in love.\\n\\nFast forward two years, I am more than sick and tired of this bitches shit, but for some unimaginable reason stick around. \\n\\nAnd then a big friend of mine and I get drunk, and end up fucking. \\n\\nOh lord, what sex that was. Incredible. I was stunned. For 4 years I didnt have good sex. And now it was served on a platter.\\n\\n So I pretty much immediately break shit off with the other harpy. And start gaming other chicks. Within a month I had 6 chicks. Jesus, this is incredible!\\n\\nThen that first friend I fucked starts getting touchy feely. Saying she misses me, wanting to be around all the time, well, you kmow the drill. \\n\\nAnd I start thinking, well, maybe it was just that other bitch.\\n\\nThis girl wont behave like that. She\\'s always cool, always wants sex, always wants me, no way she\\'ll turn on me, right?\\n\\nWho needs trp. I bet I won\\'t need it with this one.\\n\\nWrong. WRONG. \\n\\nAWALT, AWALT, AWALT. \\n\\nWithin two months, I fell for this bitch like a faggot, really hard.\\n\\nSex dropped like nothing you\\'ve ever seen, and she\\'s starting to behave like a harpy too.\\n\\nWell.. Let\\'s play then. Let\\'s go trp.\\n\\nDread, start lifting again, just dont give a fuck. Seems simple, right? Also wrong. Gotta break it off.\\n\\nYou know why boys? Because I hamstered myself into putting a recorder in her house. \\n\\nShe\\'s fucking her housemate. That\\'s right.\\n\\nShe\\'s sending me messages saying how much she loves me, all the while giving up that pussy to her housemate.\\n\\nI\\'m broken. \\'cause I let myself fall.\\n \\nWallowing in self pity, misery, and booze. \\n\\nTo any newcomer reading this, just please. Remember. AWALT. AWALT. \\n\\nAll women are like that. There isn\\'t an exception. \\n\\nMy story is one of hundreds like it. \\n\\nDon\\' t let yourself get suckered into this.',\n",

For the last 5 months we have just fucked, and I've made it clear I didn't want a relationship with her, and I had told her from the start that I was seeing other girls aswell. She wanted to talk when I had the time. I called her half an hour later.\\n\\nAfter some small talk with her, I asked what see wanted to call about. She gave me an ultimatum, she wanted to keep me as her friend but nothing more if I didn't commit to her.\\n\\nIf it weren't for TRP I would have begged her to stay, and probably went back to being her beta provider (like in the past).\\n\\nBut I said no, I ended it there. No relationship, no being friends, nothing.\\n\\nShe started crying and whatnot, and in the past this would have gotten to me, as her crying has always been my soft spot. But this didn't face me anymore and I hung up on her.\\n\\nRelief is what I've felt since that day, that I finally had the balls and brain to fucking quit it for good.\\n\\nSo thank all of you for helping me to love myself, and realise my true potential as a man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'selftext': '# Prelude\\n\\nBefore I found out about TRP, I remember laying in my bed and thinking \"is this it? I\\'m extremely unhappy with my life and I\\'m basically waiting to die of old age and I\\'m 33! This shit isn\\'t fixing itself apparently, so I need to find out what I need to do!\"\\n\\nAt that time I was completely lost in my life. I had exited from 5 years LTR about 2 years ago and had no goals or dreams where to go with my life. I bought my first appartment which ties me up for current location. I had a stable albeit bit boring job and had started lifting shortly after breakup with LTR. I wanted to get stronger. Stronglifts 5x5 worked nicely, but unfortunately I didn\\'t care to put effort to fix my diet. \\n\\nMy game was non-existent and my friends had adviced me to start using Tinder. Tinder experience was horrible, but at the same time it was eye-opening. My SMV was all-time low due to weight gained at the end of the LTR. I ended up banging some random obese chick through Tinder and hating myself shortly after.\\n\\nI had been bit successful in banging chicks during the college years, but I never quite realized how attraction really worked. I could not cold approach sober even if my life depended on it. During college I had a summer job that gave me easy access to 18-20 year olds to game and ended up hooking up usually with one for the summer. Hooking up with co-workers/customers was actually really easy for me, it was pretty natural to start conversation and have little bit of flirting in the mix.\\n\\nI had been enjoying competition in sports when I was younger and had the competitive drive in things I found myself passionate at. I had learned pretty early on that there\\'s always someone better than you and mistakes happen a lot, just try to do your best at learning from them. I knew I could do anything I wanted, it all just took commitment of energy, discipline and sacrifice. The higher you want to go, the more you need to sacrifice and exercise discipline. With sacrifice I mean mostly time, time that is out from something else. You TRP folks know already about the importance of time.\\n\\nI had lost my ways after graduating from school and started working full-time and compromising my life choices due to being bluepilled in LTR and idiot. Getting overweight, losing self-respect and I was not disciplined at all. Reason for my extreme unhappiness was not having any self-respect. I was also not giving myself credit where credit was due. I didn\\'t have patience for myself although I am extremely patient and stoic since I was born. I almost never lose my temper. I was actually unhappy in the last year or two in the LTR due to not having goals and hating myself in mirror. I just ate those lies \"you are fine as you are\". Also I didn\\'t know where to find proper information what to do.\\n\\n# Unplugging\\n\\nAfter digesting TRP sidebar information, it all made sense. All those subtle hints, non-verbals and intergender dynamics. The natural attraction potential I once had which I could not explain or understand. I had rebelled against my gut feeling so many times, due to social programming. My life just got a meaning again.\\n\\nI decided to fix my shit and become THE shit. Unleash my potential and see how far I can go. I had seen and enjoyed lifting progress through Stronglifts but suffered minor knee, shoulder and elbow injuries which hindered my progress. I wanted to try something else and switched my lifting routine to reverse pyramid program from Leangains. I also started counting my calories and set my goal to lose weight to 75 kg by the end of the year. I was 90 kg at the time. I bought a proper scale that measures BF% just for fun progress tracking even if it\\'s not even remotely accurate.\\n\\nI spent these months reading about body language, game, PUA tricks, etc. on my spare time when I\\'m not at work or at the gym lifting. Currently reading Rollo\\'s and Roosh\\'s books. I recommend them, but for new unplugged I\\'d advice either read the books or their blogs. Maybe books first and blogs for additional information on selected topics. Information overlap is quite big so constant repetition can get boring at times.\\n\\n# Present\\n\\nWeighted 79 kg this morning, well in range of weight loss progress curve. Reached intermediate lifting goals for deadlift and squat (bench press is lagging a bit) after two years of lifting. I love taking off shirt in front of a mirror nowadays. My friends and family have congratulated me for transformation. Learning more about game every day. Did my first cold approaches daytime about a month ago and that was eye opening experience.\\n\\nLast week I went out clubbing on Friday and Saturday. Both night I was opened by smoking hot blonds (HB8-9) at bar counter with intense eye contact when I was going to get my first drink. Due to beginner level game, I botched both situations but I didn\\'t care too much. It feels impossible that formerly completely INVISIBLE person (me) is getting attention from the most gorgeous babes without me doing anything other than keeping my body language open and being dominant with EC. Competition is terrible here I suppose, heh.\\n\\nWhile I still have a lot of work to do in all areas of my life, I\\'m genuinely happy for the first time in my life. I know what to do now. Next year I\\'m going to pack on more muscle and try to go for 15%ish BF.\\n\\nI went out last night to practice approaching and going clubbing tonight. On Thursday. I\\'m already looking forward to it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThank you brothers for helping me to save my life!',\n",

Slowly changing and it seems that when I fully show the change, they go full out attack on me. Read 48LoP and it was oh so TRUE! I game those chicks, they say I am some sort of loser and should stop. I get good grades, they say I just memorized and know my place. I try to better my appearance, they say I am vain and gay. Just recently, people think I am some sort of lazy fuckboy snob not taking his studies then everyone going mob mentality on me. The whole school, teachers and even classmates all want my head on a stake. That is where I know that I have truly reclaimed my LIFE and slowly becoming a WINNER. This is all thanks to TRP. Without them, I wouldnt be where I am today. Though I am still not up to those in the high caliber, I will slowly and discreetly get there taking all the shit I have gotten as a lesson. Thank you very much TRP!',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I want to thank RedPill for showing me the reality (my fundamental principle is the TRUTH above all things, however unpleasant it may be) but I am also sad. You see, I always knew in the depths of my being that women had these attitudes (I was born with an abusive mother and an absent father who worked all day and is also beta), but I always thought that there would be a woman who would be different (ONEitis, I know) that would make me feel like a man, that would not judge me, that would accept what I am, follow my steps and love me for my qualities. It turns out that 2 weeks ago I found this community, I'm reading The Rational Male and everything has been demoralizing for me. By the way, I'm 24 years old.\\nIt is certainly difficult to swallow the Red Pill and the hardest thing is when you start to apply what you learned and everything starts to fit. I'm from Argentina but I see that it will always be AWALT, no matter what.\\nI share classes with a sexy woman (8/10) and I have started to apply a lot of things (be playful, guide her, be a rock that can not be moved, be an emotional support). I began to receive MANY shit tests that left me exhausted (thinking about going through them cost me a lot but I play it all great) and let me show you what happened in the last shit test.\\nWhen the class ends and we are preparing our things to leave, this happens:\\nher: - Let's go (he says to a friend as he gets up from the seat). And you too (in a serious tone and looking at me).\\nMe: - You will not be able to move me.\\nI get up from my seat and stand in front of her, giving her my back.\\nme: - Try it, you do not have a chance.\\nshe starts to laugh, she touch my back and leans her body against mine. Then she says: - I'm sleepy.\\nDo not get me wrong, I felt great, I felt like I was starting to connect with her. The problem was not there, walking down the street and talking to everyone (we were 6) she starts talking without any sense and raising the voice of how another boy (whom she NEVER spoke to) ignores her and that she felt sad that the boy did that (he said it with a smile on his face and laughing, certainly his words didnt match with his emotional state. Sounds familiar? SHIT TEST)\\nI really ignored it and luckily everyone too. Thinking about receiving these shit tests all my life, being judged without stopping, exhausting me. And I feel sad, I feel that I will never be able to relax when I am with a girl that I like.\\nI know, it may be very beta, I'm a cool guy (here in Argentina I achieved about 200 matches in Tinder in a span of 2 months, although most were ugly) and friendly, I know how to behave rudely if the situation requires, but not I hoped to do it with women.\\nI use this almost as a rant, but at the same time I know I can empathize with you, guys. Believe me, as beautiful as a girl is, there is NOTHING beyond the sex that she can offer you, instead they ask you for EVERYTHING.\\nI would love to know your experiences.\\nExcuse my English, I'm still learning it.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Really, from the bottom of my Machiavellian, narcissistic, psychopathic heart, thank you all, from the Senior ECs to the recently unplugged shitposters. I found TRP at the right time in my life. I didn\\'t come in a kissless virgin, but I was operating on autopilot, looking for my Unicorn, and had been burned more than I care to elaborate. TRP turned me around. It\\'s more than just getting laid. I\\'ve been lifting for 5 years now and look better and meaner than I thought possible. A HB8 checkout girl asked me if I was a model today. People get out of my way in public like Moses parting the Red Sea. I stopped eating like crap and take my daily routine seriously. Stopped smoking pot. I\\'ve finally given myself permission to assert myself and/or be a dick whenever I feel like it, and people love me for it! Did you know you can just ask a girl back to your place after a few minutes of sarcastic banter, and it will work? Did you know a good Tinder opener is \"come over\"? Old me wouldn\\'t even consider it, though I guess I had all of this stuff buried in head somewhere, fake it till you make it works. It isn\\'t faking, it\\'s more like a starter motor in an automobile. Activate some shit that you have innately, just get out there and do it and eventually the real deal will come to life. But as they say, \"you gotta reach for the top to stay on the mountain\". Anyway, I owe each of you a beer, a big man hug, and one of my spare kidneys if anybody needs it, just PM me. Cheers!\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Been a long time lurker but never really took this stuff seriously or knew how to properly execute what I was learning. Simply because I lacked confidence and had a fear of getting what I wanted.\\n\\nI\\'m 22. Just graduated from college, tall, handsome, athletic, outgoing, etc. Since I was young, I always got word of really hot girls having crushes on me but I could never do anything about it. I was terrified of talking to girls.\\n\\nLuckily, I went to a party school so it was really easy to get very drunk with my friends and hit on sorority sluts later in the night. But this kind of sex never felt forfilling or fun after the matter. Party because more often than not, I\\'d find out how godamn slutty they are but mostly because I was never really developing a sense of attraction that makes them wet, boosts my ego and drive to bang them. \\n\\nAnytime I pulled a girl that was really hot, I could never sustain it for more than two hookups because I didn\\'t know what I was doing. I\\'d pull a bunch of beta shit and think because I banged her once, I don\\'t need to try (which is true to an extent: just not true to the way I was handling it)\\n\\n\\nAnyways, I met a girl a week before graduating and found out she\\'s from my hometown and this is right as my confidence was boosting from TRP and I just did everything perfectly. I didn\\'t text her just to text her, I was direct, I called her out on bailing a couple times by saying things like, \"It\\'s fine. You aren\\'t the only indecisive bailer that I know.\" \\n\\nAnyways, long story short. I spent a lot of time actually learning the theories on TRP and reading all-time top posts and got laid by this girl and it was a great time. We went out for one drink and I used the teasing theories very effectively which led us to drinking heavily, hooking up on the beach, and taking an uber back to her place.\\n\\nIt is also important to note that she is really chill and I could tell has a handful of guy friends so to prove my value and set my intentions, I started letting her know that I wanted to fuck. E.g. she got up to goto the bathroom and said, \"I\\'ll be right back. Don\\'t roofie me while I\\'m gone.\" (there was plenty of context to make the joke friendly). So I kept teasing when she got back and about 15 minutes later I said, \"Okay, I\\'m going to run to the bathroom. You better not roofie me now.\" She goes, \"Oh yeah, that\\'s the only reason I decided to go this date.\" I say, \"So you could roofie me and take me home? I\\'m down for the roofies. But I don\\'t know if I\\'d go home with you.\" Walked away... Got back, and noticed her immediately making more contact with me because I turned the tables on her.\\n\\n\\nAnyways, I didnt even proof read this or have the vocab terms memorized but thank you TRP experts. It\\'s legit shit you\\'re teaching here.',\n",

But now at least I have a goal and focus, also I realize how crucial this work is to create a life worth talking about.  \\nI'm writing this thank you because I tested TRP after reading the sidebar.  I permitted myself to be a complete BP beta on a few dates.  Bought them dinner, interview style date, hoped for the best, wrote thank you texts after.  When the tumble weeds blew through the ghost town named Blue Pill, I didn't take it personally.  I was acting like a little bitch.  Now the work of not doing this socially designed behavior has begun.  Love the challenge, love the results, love not feeling like life isn't in my control.  \\nCheers gentlemen thanks for paving a path for me to walk down.  \",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'It\\'s funny - blue pill world view is SO appealing.  Wouldn\\'t it be nice if things were like that?\\n\\nI was your typical AFC.  Lost virginity at 22.  Married my first girlfriend (and had a nice sexless marriage for a bit).  Continued on my journey, and coupled up with a great girl (emotionally stable, non-needy, outcome independent, etc) .  And then - I just coasted.  I\\'m pretty awesome. All I need to do is just be awesome and she\\'ll be on board, right?\\nGentlemen - the game never stops. I let my guard down, revealed weakness, allowed her \"space\", and then knife in the back ghosting.  I didn\\'t realize that LTRs have regular shit tests. My goodness.\\nThis allowed me to find the Red Pill - and a true understanding of how human sexual interaction works.  The best position a man can be in - higher value, with the threat of leaving in the undercurrent in order to foster loyalty.\\nI did not find this view obvious at all.  I\\'m pretty high SMV (5\\'11\", 200 lbs and very in shape, great job, start up on the side, etc).  My management structure has always been collaborative, rather than top down. But - I work with mostly men.  And this is not ideal for relationships.\\nBig thank you to this community for helping men create and keep deep and meaningful relationships.',\n",

But this time was different. I\\'ve watched the scene from other perspective - trough the eyes of Neo and i\\'ve said to myself: \" How would my life be IF that pill EXISTS? \"\\nWith google\\'s help i got into reddit/TRP, and started to read, and when i say READ, i mean few hours without any break. \\nAfter a while a sit back and i was trying to digest everything i\\'ve read. Believe me, it was painful. I couldn\\'t believe that i\\'ve wasted so many years of my life being \"nice\", being \"moral\", being \"the one who gives a fuck\".. I was angry and frustrated at the same time. I was angry at me, i was angry at every fucking person i\\'ve been \"good\" with and in return i got NOTHIG. \\nI still cannot believe how the majority of good people are treated like shit. \\n\\nThanks for the slap! I really need it!\\nTime to rule my own shit!\\n',\n",

Each and everytime I have been failing the interview, i was basically a submissive pussy. I have been reading trp for awhile and have taken the concepts of frame and leadership on board. And I aced my interview! My competion was alot more qualified than me - this was for a position teaching kids maths and english. One of the candidates was a damn teacher, but i managed to beat her.\\n\\nI was the youngest candidate, i was up againt 1 man and a woman (who was the teacher). We had to do a group excercise based on a scenario, me and the man were \"fighting\" over leadership, but he eventually lost since he wasn\\'t showing alot of confidence. When he wanted to make a decision he would ask my permission, whereas i would do the idea and ask the group if their were any objections. Also I had the strongest body-language of them all!\\n\\nFinally when it came to the face-face interview, i was showing good body language and even managed to crack a joke.\\n\\nToday/the next day i had recieved an email commenting on my very impressive leadership skills, and the managers were suprised about a younger person leading.\\n\\nTHANKS TRP!',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Big shout out to TRP. I’ve been perusing these subs for the last few months and it has been immensely beneficial. I’m here like so many of you all – to make sense of women and myself in relation to them. So biological, yet so confounding.\\n\\nI’m 32 and coming out of a four-year marriage. Long story short, I met my wife while living overseas and eventually brought her back to the USA with me. She has not been willing/able to adapt to me or the life here in the USA and has thus returned to her home country to try restarting her life.\\n\\nOf course, this was quite devastating to me, as I thought we had our issues but that we’d try to work through them. It has been two months since we separated. I’ve been keeping her at a distance, only communicating sparingly. We told ourselves that we’d try to remain friends even if we couldn’t work things out as spouses. Okay, whatever makes it easier on me during the divorce process.\\n\\nIt was a gut punch, but one that I’ve taken before (she has threatened divorce on more than one occasion). She just kept going further and further with it. This time it felt real enough, so I took it as that. I let her go. I reflected on just how much of myself I was having to sacrifice for her without nearly as much being reciprocated. She was extremely selfish and childish (I saw it in her from the beginning but I thought she’d grow out of it…not so much). I bent over backwards to make things work, but the shit always resurfaced. Why continue the slog?\\n\\nShe's beginning to express regret, but fuck it. She has given me the opportunity to make a clean break and start anew, so I'm running with it. We don’t have kids or assets, and she’s hundreds of miles away now. We’re both relatively young and will be just fine. We don’t need each other the way we initially thought. She said as much before, and I agree.\\n\\nI’ve been reading into TRP topics lately to recalibrate. With so much making sense now, and my confidence up significantly, I’m excited about becoming a free man again. I’m in a different place compared to where I was before I got married – a much better place.\\n\\nI’m still having a difficult time finding the motivation to go out alone, but I’ll get there. The desperation should sink in eventually. Until then I’m in monk mode, or something like that.\\n\\nAnyway, thanks TRP for enlightening me during a challenging time in my life.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"It was hard, and it was bitter, but its worth it, and its a step in the right direction.\\n\\nI told my toxic liberal roommate to get fucked and that im not signing the lease for the 3rd year last night, I sent the landlord a letter of vacancy today. I than went into storage. Oh my god. \\n\\nUntold boxes and boxes upon just bullshit that i've been carrying around from apartment to apartment for years. I literally havent touched this shit since highschool and just never have went through it. Old slayer and metallica shirts, boxed oldschool video games I haven't touched in years, old version 3 dungeons and dragons shit, old magic the gathering shit, PC gaming stuff from highschool, heavy metal cds, a huge vhs collection of old horror movies, all kinds of weird pop culture shit. This is gonna be a 5 trip car load to goodwill pain in my ass tomorrow.\\n\\nTomorrow I clean my room and start getting ready to move. There will be many more trips of leaving hoarder shit at goodwill. I need an entire new wardrobe, ive been wearing the same torn up band shirts since highschool. My car needs to get fixed immediately, nothing major, when I have some more money I'll get my gym membership back, I started lifting in the spring but stopped because I didnt have the money to eat right and started getting laid and got complacent (classic shitty bluepill trap). I'll be back as soon as I move. I start a new job Friday, its blue collar but I can make some serious cash some day and probably retire in my 50's if I play my cards right.\\n\\nI recently cut a bunch of people off. Didnt even give them the time of day. Just blocked them on facebook and blocked their number. Some even owed me money i'll never see. I'm moving soon and moving on with my life.\\n\\nI've been living somewhere between betaville and cuckistan for years, im finally moving out of this terrible apartment and throwing out just boxes of hoarder shit ive collected over the years of just stupid nerd shit I got from goodwill and rummage sales as a kid. Time to have no roommates and grow the fuck up, what a terrible, embarassing, pathetic, materialistic  existence i've lived for the past 25 years.\\n\\nThank you. If I didnt start casually browsing these subs last year, i'd be re-signing my lease again with my roommate and still holding onto the past. At some point its just time to grow up and move on and better yourself, and leave all of the losers and bad memories behind. Time to stop being a pale skinny white nerd loser and grow up.\\n\\nI got 6 weeks to come up with $4000 to move and im gonna make it fucking work.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hey thankTRPers. Had an amusing situation last night I felt I should share; am currently in a situation where I am in a poly relationship; personally have two girlfriends and multiple plates since finding TRP about 3 years ago. Girlfriend B was hanging out with myself, girlfriend A, and girlfriend B\\'s other boyfriend. \\n\\nB\\'s other boyfriend has many beta traits despite past military service, and frequently postures when we are all together to act like the tough guy (he is a couple inches taller than myself, but he is kinda skinny). I have successfully maintained a frame of amused mastery, and last night I accidentally emasculated the poor guy.\\n\\nApparently my lifting has paid off, because a couple heavy objects needed to be moved, and I moved my set to the needed spot...but when he sauntered over to \"show me how it was done,\" he struggled to lift it and gave himself a muscle spasm...and he is younger than me. \\n\\nThanks TRP, for giving me the mindset to push myself and become fit.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I just watched the move \"The Red Pill\" and was overwhelmed and wanted to share my story. I am confident more guys have gone through this silently, like I have until now.\\n\\nI was dating this woman I\\'ll call Sheila, and sex was GREAT, times were fun, and everything was hedonistic and beautiful. Problem was, Sheila got angry and would RAGE. Now, I know a lot of what happened to me is my fault (did I just victim blame???) because I hadn\\'t swallowed the red pill, and didn\\'t either hard next when I should have or nipped that shit in the bud. But here\\'s what I went through.\\n\\nSheila would rage and hit me, throw things at me, and yell loud enough that all our neighbors in out shitty apartment could hear. She called me names, slapped me, pushed me. I chalked it up to her fiery latin heritage and endured. Tough me, stoic and calm in the storm. How noble. /s\\n\\nBut this kept escalating. One day, after I sat her down for a beta talk, she explained that she did it because she wanted to see some emotion from me! She wanted me to yell back she said. She wanted me to mirror her craziness was what the hamster pooped out.\\n\\nBut, that\\'s just not me! I want solutions, and logical thought. I want to strip the uncertainty of emotions away in the face of danger! In short, I am a MAN. Solution oriented, unwilling to express my frustration with yelling when thought could save the day.\\n\\nEventually, after suffering for months with her violence against me, including security at a hotel we were staying (whom I called, but backed down when it wasn\\'t clear I wouldn\\'t be arrested), she accused me of rape with my university.\\n\\nWhat set her off? I called her a racist. Her ego was so wrapped up in feminism, that when she loved a photo of the dalai lama with a speech bubble saying \"PREEESE FRUSH!!!\" I called her out: of course she can\\'t be racist, she\\'s too tuned in to the struggles of the oppressed! Yet, the dalai lama speaks fluent english, so that\\'s bullshit and cheap joke racism. What happened? She flipped out. That was the end. She called the police when I wasn\\'t looking and worked herself into tears. Her nuclear option in controlling/punishing me. (You won\\'t be surprised to hear she told me to \"confess\" and she\\'d get back together with me. She didn\\'t even understand the gravity of what she had done by accusing me to begin with!)\\n\\nFORTUNATELY! my story ends quasi-happily because she was such a nut case that she couldn\\'t keep her story straight. As the college women\\'s shelter fed her comfort, she kept exaggerating the story. Eventually I was cleared of all claims since the final version she peddled was a caricature of the initial. Little to no consequences unfairly befell me. Except, of course, that I still have to explain a FUCKING ACCUSATION whenever I get background checked.\\n\\nThank you to the movie \"The Red Pill\" for putting male victims of domestic violence into the spotlight.\\n\\nEdit: \\n\\nMY MESSAGE TO VICTIMES OF DV: No one will help you or believe you if you just raise the claim. Build a strong network of male friends, and use their support to escape. It is HARD to reconcile masculinity with victimhood, and easy for women to reconcile femininity with victimhood. You are JUST AS WORTHY! Build a male support network and escape.\\n\\nEdit2:\\n\\nFix your financial affairs first. She will win any dispute, 100% of the time.  However, its better to be safe and broke, than be potentially thrown in jail because of her.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'A little over half a year ago, I went to Russia as part of a program to teach English to Russian children and at the same time brush up on my own Russian language skills. At the camp I taught at, there worked a very pretty girl, who reciprocated slight interest in me. Come the end of one shift, and she returned to her home town to prepare for university. Although she thought of me only as a curiosity for a handful of weeks, I already had planned out the rest of my life with her. Eventually, I found an opportunity during a trip with several of my colleagues to her home town to come hang out with us, with my hidden end goal being, of course, to proclaim my everlasting, undying love for her. One can imagine how this plan turned out.\\n\\nThere were two emotions that I felt after this trip: anger at the world for robbing me of my \\'one true love\\' and disgust at myself for being so weak. And thus began my journey into the redpill, as a disgruntled bluepill looking for an explanation as to why my avances went unanswered. After religiously reading Return of Kings I ended up at TRP and The Rational Male. And after that point there was no turning back.\\n\\nAlthough I lacked the time to start regularly going to a gym, I knew that I could work on my fashion, behavior and mental life.  I gave up masturbation. I started eating better. I picked out good clothes with my limited financial means. I started watching my posture. I became more assertive and confident, taking on the role of leader and initiator in social situations at university. I fought my anxieties, fears and paranoia. I read good, proper philosophy on the nature of life and being, in the process creating my own conception of frame. I found literature again. I set my soul on fire.\\n\\nAnd it worked. Immediately after my return people started noticing \\'how I seemed to stand taller, looked more rough hewn, a conqueror of life\\'. My friends are now sometimes \\'afraid of my incredible fire and passion\\'. I am the only one in the group who has universal respect and authority. Life becomes easier and easier, and I seek bigger and bigger challenges, test myself even more, to continue to make myself grow. My fear is a shadow of its former self. And, of course, there are the women. I am currently spinning about two plates, slowly, testing out new tactics, but with very good progress nonetheless. At a party last week I touched and kissed a girl I had met a couple of hours before without any effort. My sexuality appeared as raw, unhindered power, an extension of my being.\\n\\nThis last point is the most important: power as a natural extension of the being. My initial goal of studying the Red Pill was to meet women, but it has evolved from this point into something much more fundamental, more encompassing. TRP has freed me from doubt, the judgement of others and fears, and in this way has allowed my true being and power into my life. The women have become secondary (which only brings more and more of them to me). To refer to the Russian language, I have become самовластный in my life. This word, which is combined from the roots сам- \"self\" and власть \"power\" usually means autocratic, but  can be more literally interpreted to mean \"self-controlling\" or \"self-ruling\". TRP has my eternal thanks for helping me reach this state and freeing me from my weaknesses. I still have a long way to walk, but I have no more fear. За вас! Here\\'s to you!',\n",

I saw a different outlook on life and thought my behavior needed changing to focus more on myself. The red pill was a perfect fit. \\n\\nI have developed good habits \\n- Gym 5 times a week, no missed days \\n- Sports/Photography during my free time \\n- Maintained sleep schedule \\n- Keep eye contact \\n- Always checking up on posture \\n- Talk slower and check tone \\n- Somewhat controlled diet \\nResults - Lost 70 lbs, strongest I've ever been, oozing confidence, can see my dick, made my ever first booty call, able to flirt more aimlessly, can direct a group comfortably. \\n\\nAlso cut some bad ones \\n- No more daily pot smoking \\n- No more biting nails \\n- No more binging on Netflix\\n- No more binge eating \\n- No more sleeping all day\\n- No more jerking off \\n\\nLooking back this has been the best year of my life, my mood is completely improved, I don't let shit get to me and shrug it off. I also have seen that I lost a lot of my selfish traits, I make my intentions known and act accordingly. \\n\\nI can finally see direction in my life, I know what I have to do and plan for my future. I no longer obsess over the little things and can be focused completely on myself. \\nI still have plenty to work on: being a foolish kid landed me some unneeded car debt, I have some problems with forgetting to eat, I have not pushed myself to my true potential, need some improved financial responsibility, and would like to improve my game with women.\\n\\n\\nI never thought I would reach this point in my life, being content with my current situation.

       "  'selftext': '**Background:** recent ex-Christian, hopeless romantic beta in past and leading expert on the friend-zone. Recently found TRP which challenged and is changing my (remnant Christian) beta views on women, relationships, sex, dating, … Still scared shitless of non-christian girls due to upbringing.\\n\\n**Context:** Fancied a girl -fellow student- for a while and grew balls to talk to her instead of creeping around as I probably would have in the past (thanks TRP!). Grew them some more - still scared shitless though - and asked her out for a drink (Thanks TRP!). First response, “Oh sorry, really busy this evening, but I would love to some other time”. No problem, give it a rest and try again couple of days later. “Oh I really have no time tonight, sorry” was the answer once more… Oh well, probably no interest, moving on (thanks TRP!). Until, the next day “Hey, I’m looking for someone to grab some Ice-cream with, you interested?”.\\n\\n**Situation:** Curiosity spiked, there perhaps is interest! We met up, I stayed calm, assertive and just my jolly old self (thanks TRP!). Ended up in a quiet park in beautiful sunshine. Great chemistry, body language open and welcoming, no rejection of physical escalation, things are looking great! But then, “I can’t stay too long, I have dinner arrangements with my sister and my BOYFRIEND”. Turns out she’s in an 18-month relationship! Didn’t mention it once even though I –obviously - asked her out on two separate occasions. This however did not break me because I did not invest too much in her beforehand as I would have previously (Thanks TRP!). I then was brutally honest about my intentions in meeting up with her and called her out on her bullshit mixed signalling, whilst holding frame (thanks TRP!). This is something I could not have dreamt of in the past because women were like holy beings to me (Thanks TRP!).  She seems a bit startled that I called it out, apologises. I swiftly make an end to any following conversations and we part ways soon after. \\n\\n**Conclusion:** Where Beta-me would have apologized for not being aware she had a boyfriend and ended up in a  horribly awkward friend-zone pit of doom. I now, head held high, walk towards a future filled with endless opportunity. THANKS TRP!\\n\\n*TL,DR: First date with girl turns sour after she mentions her never before mentioned boyfriend. Thanks to TRP did not end up in the friend-zone but called her out on her bullshit mixed signalling. **Thanks TRP!** *\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'It is unbelievable that my wife now for several days in a row is after me every day for kinky hot sex.  I asked her last night what got into her and why she wants my body and drive me wild with pleasure so seriously.  She said she deosn\\'t know or understand it but she cannot get enough.\\n\\nOf course, I understand it very well now thanks to TRP and other red pill ideas that I learned over the last several years.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested, I will enjoy to share my journey in more detail.  Here\\'s some basic facts.\\n\\n1. Married 25 years to hot Island girl.\\n2. Raised in abusive violent family.\\n3. Believed in blue pill ideas until about 3 years ago.\\n4. Spent a couple years with lots of girls after me\\n    complimenting and flirting with me while my wife\\n    still couldn\\'t see me that way. So I really struggled\\n    with the idea of dropping her.\\n5. But she had a valid point that I was the one that \\n   had the bad childhood and made marriage hard, which\\n   she endured loyally for 20 years. \\n6. I got really determined to understand the female \\n   pyschology until could make her lust for me again.\\n\\nAnd it has finally worked. I mean sex has been improving\\nevery month, but she is a girl gone wild now. \\n\\nI never posted anything online about my journey or discoveries\\nuntil now. But my gratitude and desire to sing it from the\\nroof tops is pushing me to post rather than lavish my wife\\nwith praise that she didn\\'t really earn.\\n\\nLast night?  We attended a wedding.  She was thrilled that \"her man\" was the best dressed there and all the compliments she got on my dancing and entertainment.  Afterwards, she wanted me and I told her no. Not tonight. She said, why not?  I said because there was so many beautiful young women their looking sexy and dancing. I want to enjoy those thoughts and not give you a chance to erase that out of my head too quickly.\\n\\nWell her little hamster went to town in very bold determination to rock my world again.  \\n\\nThen I stopped her in the middle of passion and told her very calmly to go. She clung to me with all her might as I tried to push her out of bed. She said, \"this is all wrong. You can\\'t send me away. I\\'m the one to go away.\"   I said you cannot do this kind of crazy hot sex with me every single day, you\\'re going to fry my brain.  she held on for dear life, struggling to stay in the bed, \"I don\\'t care. so what if I fry your brain.\"\\n\\nSo I compromised and said you can stay but calm down and just lay here and cuddle a while.\\n\\nHa ha....poor little hamster was running furiously.\\n\\nNeedless to say it she only got hungrier.\\n\\nI stopped her again before my climax and said she needs some control and calm. She needs to wait tomorrow to enjoy that.\\n\\nShe begged and pleaded like a little girl wanting cotton candy to get me to orgasm for her.\\n\\nI \"relented\" after a little while.\\n\\nShe slept like a baby.  \\n\\nEveryone tells her that she is looking younger and younger. I agree.\\n\\nI told her last night it\\'s because of the emotions of passion that make her look so young and happy.\\n\\nIt\\'s incredibly fun to have HER wrapped around my finger instead of the other way around.\\n\\nIf you\\'re curious, I\\'m happy to share everything that I did to change into a chick magnet and switch on her furiously excited hamster.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'TL;DR Better late than never.\\n\\nGuys I was born with a lot of gifts.  Gifts the Blue Pill told me would make my dating life a breeze.  Tall, smart, good looking, and Alpha.  Wait?  What? Alpha?  Since I took TRP, guess what?  I recently found out that being Alpha in every aspect of life except dating and with women, made me Beta.  \\n\\nHow did it happen?  Year one to Year 12-domineering Mom in a single parent household.  Listened to her, grandma, aunt, etc.  “Do everything women want and they will love you forever”  Year 12-17-raging Alpha Dad married to step mom.  Dad cheats on step mom and gets caught.  Whole house blows up.  I\\'m now separated from half siblings and living in a run-down trailer park.  Dad taught me how to fight, lead, solve problems, self-educate, survive in the wild.  I admired those things about him but hated his destruction of my family unit.  \\n\\nI vowed to never be like Dad when it came to women, so I Blue Pilled it up and floundered for 23 years when it came to dating.  I heard about TRP a while back and because it reminded me of Dad, I said no way.  Plus I was Alpha (in my mind), so TRP could not be the solution to my problem.  Adding some PUA tricks seemed \"beneath me\".  The gifts are a curse without TRP.  The gifts also saved me from 23 years of incel hell.  Good and bad I guess.  If you’re lucky, not having the gifts will drive you to TRP faster.    \\n\\nI got dumped about a year ago from a 3 year LTR.  I’m 39 years old and still the disposable boyfriend.  Still didn\\'t get it.  I went MGTOW out of pain, picked up a 2nd job, since I decided that I would be better off taking the time I would be spending money on women and just earning more money.  I was.  Money is awesome.  \\n\\n2nd job is security at a bar in a college town.  I\\'m still MGTOW.  I notice something however.  Women start approaching me and giving me their number, wholly unsolicited.  So I step out of MGTOW and see what I can do.  Still crash and burn though.  Still a Blue Pill Beta.  Still not getting it.\\n\\nLost in youtube one day, I stumble across an antifem conservative female political blogger.  She talks about the benefit of TRP.  Yeah guys.  A woman on youtube convinced me to look into TRP.  Here I am.  I test.  It works.  There’s a fine line between stubborn and stupid.  \\n\\nMind=Blown.  I\\'m still learning, still testing, but I have more prospects now than I\\'ve had in 20 years of relying on just looks, fitness, and morals.  My biggest challenge so far is the hamster visualization.  Thinking about it makes me laugh, sometimes out loud, when I can see I’ve triggered the hamster with a date.  She asks, “What’s so funny?”  I just say, “Nothing, inside joke” and then start dying of laughter more because my mystery just sent hamster into a full caffeinated fit.  I’m making the problem work in my favor.    \\n\\nI’m still working on the sidebar.  There’s a lot of volume and a lot to digest.  Reprogramming 22 years of adulthood topping 18 years of dysfunctional childhood emasculation ain’t easy.  You won’t be seeing posts from me for a while.  All I can say is don’t be like me.  If you’re not surrounded by prospects begging for it right now, you’re doing it wrong, gifts or no gifts.  Get your ass into the side bar and sort your shit out.        \\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"tl;dr: The only person who can fix you is you. NO exceptions.\\n\\nI got a divorce last year, and started hitting the gym and reading TRP. It was immensely helpful and pulled me out of a hole, and gave me the confidence and information I needed to start dating again.\\n\\nI wasn't really happy with my job when I got back into dating. I wasn't happy with my health. Some of my best friends had recently moved away and I felt isolated and lonely. I drank too much, smoked too much -- even with the gym, it just felt like I was giving into those short-term dopamine hits instead of working towards a long-term goal. \\n\\nBut SURELY the problem was just loneliness, right? Once I had a girlfriend I'd be normal! I'd be happy! All my problems were because I was living alone -- once I had that special someone this would all somehow correct itself, like a ship finding its north star.\\n\\nWithin six months I had a chain of girls I was dating. Eventually one got serious. Now we're exclusive. She is eager to do everything I want in the bedroom, is happy to take me out to places I like, is happy to listen, is doing everything in her power to be the best girlfriend on the planet for me...\\n\\n...and it's changed nothing. Zip. I am getting regular sex, in any position I like, with whatever crazy fetishes I can think of, as many times as I like. She's eager to listen, she loves taking me out places. But that doesn't change me not liking my job. That doesn't help me wanting to get quick dopamine fixes out of drinking or smoking. \\n\\nSo I started reading TRP again. And this time, apart from dating, REALLY understanding its teachings.\\n\\nA woman can give you PHYSICAL satisfaction -- she can perform every act in the bedroom you've ever dreamed of, and concoct a few others you hadn't even thought of. \\n\\nShe can give you EMOTIONAL satisfaction -- she can relate to your problems, and be a good listener, and be empathetic to your  needs. \\n\\nA woman can give you INTELLECTUAL satisfaction -- she can stimulate you in debate, and make you think about things differently, and challenge you in clever and engaging ways.\\n\\nA woman can never change you if you want to be changed.\\n\\nA woman can never fix you if you want to be fixed.\\n\\nA woman can never make you forget the things that need changing and fixing.\\n\\nA lot of times, we're running from ourselves. And for a lot of guys, that means running into a relationship. There's nothing wrong with a relationship. But you're never going to find what you're truly looking for there. If anything, you'll have a BETTER relationship if you find what you're looking for FIRST.\",\n",

I want to make it clear how much I appreciate those who have taken vicious verbal assaults and continued to produce life changing content. I'm out of my teens and just scored my first real date. In fact, this is the first person I've ever asked out! I would have been able to do it without you eventually but because of your stories I was able to learn from others' successes and failures without the pain. Because of you I'm 1-1!\\n\\nTo those questioning the red pill, maybe reading through these posts to determine if trp is credible: look through the sidebar and posts and soon you will find someone who understands, at a fundamental level, the exact situation you are in. You will have many epiphanies very soon. Good luck.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I am a 21 year old with a mid six figure net worth (made money off my startup). I just want to say thank you to TRP, which I discovered a few years ago, for making sure that no woman will get to lay claim to my net worth or earnings. I \"knew\" that divorce was bad, especially for a HNW individual, and \"knew\" that pre-nups didn\\'t work, but after looking at the posts on TRP today I realized that there just is no way possible to make anything resembling marriage work in the US for a man like myself. The facts are here, I suggest you take a look: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1xbwqk/some_truths_about_prenups_and_divorce_law/\\n\\nI have a knack for being contrarian and doing things a little differently from the rest of the world. It\\'s why I\\'ve built products that have done well in the marketplace, it\\'s why I find value and opportunity where others see nothing under the sun. I found it annoying (to say the least) at a young age when I was being told to pay for what women want when they had their own money to do so. Logically, it made no sense (and continues to make no sense). Divorce is the logical conclusion of such idiocy. I have since resolved to engage only in LTRs at MOST and only if I can do so in a manner that will not legally turn the cohabitation into a marriage. LTRs are not my goal at all of course, simply an upper bound. \\n\\nAs a business owner, my life is a constant game of risk vs reward, or the art of taking calculated gambles. From that perspective, marriage is entirely useless and unnecessary gamble. Want to raise a child? Adopt. Want a biological child? Hire a \\'Baby Mom\\' and use your spem.  Want companionship? Psychologists know that the Limerence (or Passion) phase of a relationship is guaranteed to vanish in 1.5 to 3 years. After that, the relationship devolves into a much more boring phase known as the \"commitment\" phase. The passion once present in the Limerence phase gives way to a sort of mutual tolerance that lacks all the excitement of the previous phase. Unfortunately, this transition is rarely graceful or enjoyable, which is why the vast majority of \\'great relationships\\' fall apart. It is simply not psychologically possible for a couple to remain in Limerence. So, to my fellow TRPers who have swallowed the pill and will forever abstain from marriage, take solace in the fact you are not missing out on much. You can achieve the same psychological benefits simply with a series of LTRs that run the course of Limerence. \\n\\nIn fact, for the majority of human history (meaning pre-19th century) marriage for the sake of love was considered bizarre and unsafe. Love was unanimously known to be a temporary emotion, one which made little sense as the basis for any sort of contract. Anyway, the point is that the conflation of marriage and \\'love\\' is completely wrong. So not only are you, a TRP man, not missing out on much psychologically, you\\'re accepting the correct understanding of marriage that our ancestors have held since the dawn of time. I hope this long winded post can be of use to those swallowing the pill for the first time that were intending to get married. Know that you are stronger than women and that you have the power to get everything emotionally and physically that you want out of women without marriage. You don\\'t need it and you never will. Thanks TRP. \\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Gentlemen,\\n\\nThe past year has been a wild ride starting from uncertainty, doubt, anger, and then determination (the usual cycle that RPers seem to observe among fresh RP readers).\\n\\nI started as the classic high school loser - 17, tall, very thin, painfully awkward with the ladies, didn't attend any dances. I was definitely involved - I ran track/XC (contributed to my ridiculously light weight), was in clubs, played an instrument - just absolutely invisible because I was too afraid to let people into my mind, even though I knew I was truly a **good** person deep down. I think the first step towards improvement after discovering TRP is realizing **you are a genuine person who deserves respect, no matter your situation**.\\n\\nI didn't want to believe what I was reading initially. In fact, the sidebar material was such a shock, I would actually tremble sometimes while I read it. Everything I observed in high school became clear. I saw my orbiting for my oneitis. I saw the social dynamics at play. Most importantly, I realized how far I had to go.\\n\\nAs my track season ended, I decided I was done with running. I got started on the SL 5x5 program ASAP. To this date, I have gained about 30 pounds while maintaining a low BF % (I have about 30 pounds to go until I'll be pretty happy with my physique). I've learned to love the grind. I can't find much enjoyment in long-distance running sports anymore. I've since taken up small-boat sailing, playing the trumpet, and some other hobbies to fill the time running did.\\n\\nNevertheless, with lifting came confidence and improvements in body language, interactions with people, etc and I finally feel respected rather than invisible. The knowledge contained here is definitely appreciated and cherished. I hope other young men will find their way here as I did, and choose to think about what they read.\\n\\nI just wanted to get this out there as a THANK YOU to all of the members who have inspired me along the way - I'm a longtime lurker, have never posted on TRP since I visited for the first time a year ago. Shoutouts to endorsed contributors, the mods, and of course GLO.\\n\\nI don't expect you to have read this far, this post was meant for more of my sake.\\n\\n**TL;DR** Was awkward skinnyboi, found TRP, now not awkward, slightly less skinnyboi\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Bare with me boys, I dont really know where to start here but I feel the thanks is extremely necessary.\\n\\nMet this girl. Started of sexually clear. Made mistake of thinking 18 year old baddie was capable of relationship. Began to act like that was what i wanted. She shuts it down. I deny it was my intention. I try and lead sexually one night in future. She cries from flashbacks of childhood situation shes just remembering at this stage in her life.\\n\\nFast forward: Ive tied her into one of my social cirlces. She fucks one of my accomplices when i didnt think she was capable due to past times and her telling me \"SHE HAD TO CARE ABOUT SOMEONE TO HAVE SEX WITH THEM\". I explode internally when told this by her, but keep cool and unreactive (thank you RSD Tyler). \\n\\nActions not words, boys. Crucial.\\n\\nAfter hearing that, I knew something deeper about my thoughts about woman was unclear, regardless of the amounts of RSD shit i\\'d listened to. I needed something more thorough and foundational. I got that, The Rational Male. Read it over winter break. While reading, had her come shopping with me, buy me a steak and went to a party with her with one goal in mind to give her one last chance to fuck me before i never initiate contact with her again. She gives resistance, doesnt put out. Gets picked up by this dude @ 4am i know is a fuckin pimp. She tries to hug me on way out. I reject. She asks if im mad, i say no and watch her walk out.\\n\\nAfter that door shut, i blew up silently! I COULDNT BELIEVE IT, I thought i did everything right that night only to watch her get picked up by another dude @ 4 am. I didnt sleep till 7am. Stayed up reading The Rational Male.\\n\\nFast forward: she initiates contact again saying she visited my work. I cool guy her. Knowing I\\'d see her at a party me and my boys just started hosting.\\n\\nFast forward. I Fingered one of her stinky pussied accomplices twice (thinking she\\'d come back fresh the next time...didn\\'t haha, no dick for you) and fucked one of her friends all in the same 3 week period. Thanks to the RP. Im not sure if she knows. But she seems to be getting a little more sexually open to my advances and playing back. We\\'ll see.\\n\\nBut anyway after reading that book, i don\\'t feel lost or mislead anymore. The reality of the game is clearer. And now it\\'s really time to start having some fun, and quit being a helpless victim running on the hamster wheel of ignorance we know as the blue pill. \\n\\nThis shit hit hard, in a lot of good ways. \\n\\nThank you.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I was in a on again off again relationship since thanksgiving. Things were moving fast and to a good place. After a great date I tried to push through LMR. It didn\\'t work and she hamstered me for like 2 weeks.\\n\\nDuring this time I found The Red Pill subreddit. Started hitting the gym (up 15 lbs in a month). I\\'m feeling and looking significantly better. I also started reading the sidebar and found that I had been living a lie for my life. Letting women control the relationship. \\n\\nA new me started. I started to gain confidence with women and the rest is history. I was still in class up till last week with the girl that had been hamstering me. She started to see I had confidence, looking better than her, and generally happy. Well she tries to come back in my life. \\n\\nAt first I just try to plate her. Unfortunately, some blue pill tendencies resume. She ends up blowing me off for a date. I respond by complete radio silence (delete her from all social media). She ended up sending me a ridiculous amount of snaps. I  text her telling her I saw them and wished her a merry christmas. \\n\\nInstant responses. She tried to talk over text and I steered the conversation toward meeting up. We meet up today. Date went really well. I lead and she was in my frame the entire time. \\n\\nFast forward a few hours I get a text saying \"she\\'s emotionally unavailable right now\" and \"she has nothing to offer right now\". Blue Pill me would have done some beta shit and said that I understood and was willing to wait.\\n\\nThe red pill me ended it with the emotional trainwreck that was her life. Thank you for saving me from a life of hamstering and bullshit. I am on to better women.  \\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nRed Flag list really added to realizing the emotional baggage I was getting into:\\n\\nShe has mostly guy friends (so many orbiters, dudes that \"professed their love for her\" LIKE WTF)\\n\\nShe has daddy/mommy issues and/or divorced parents (endless)\\n\\nShe is bad with money/supported by her family/shit job (buys a motorcycle in november in the North??? works two jobs)\\n\\nShe likes to drink. (blew me off to drink by herself)\\n\\nShe cheated previously on somebody else (with a girl no less)\\n\\nShe has major emotional stability issues.\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Three years ago:             \\n               \\n- 26 years old, living in a basement with a toxic, nobody, inferiority-complex-harboring roommate.\\n- University drop out. \\n- No friends, no mentors, no support network. \\n- Virgin, no girlfriend, picked up cheap hookers to get laid. \\n- Made $30k/year, nailing wood together in a shipping yard, with unskilled immigrant laborers. \\n- No one in my company knew I existed or cared. Professionally, I was a nobody. \\n- Played video games when not sleeping or working. \\n- Dressed like I was 9, poor personal hygiene. \\n- Incredibly poor social skills, lack of emotional intelligence, insight into other people. \\n- Overweight (352 lbs), struggled with depression, and suicidal ideation continually. \\n- Life focus was the lower half of Maslow\\'s hierarchy of needs: http://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow-pyramid.jpg\\n        \\nThen I decided, for whatever reason, to change things. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uVOWQLfYd4      \\nToday:      \\n\\n- I\\'m 29, living downtown in a penthouse suite, with a (male) rommate who is not only older, wiser, and I respect, but who respects me, and has given me actionable career and personal-growth advice. He has also quantitatively improved the career of at least two other people I know - his friends. I respect him immensely. \\n- Still a university dropout, but now with two of the highest sought-after certifications in my field. \\n- Definitely not a virgin - laid by two club sluts in the last ~5 weeks, cold pickup at a club, and had sex at THEIR place, no my apartment. \\n- Make 82k/year base, and ~15k-25k in (free) company stock benefits working for one of the top five software manufacturers on the planet. \\n- Professional development.\\n-- a) I have 4 emails from people at LEAST 2 layers of management above me, thanking me for completing a project 1 week ahead of the deadling approximately 1 week ago.        \\n-- b) I have two juniors who individually took me out for coffee about 2-3 weeks ago, asking for career advice. And you know what I told them? I told them I appreciate their trust and inquiry, and I\\'m going to spend the Dec/Jan vacation preparing to give them advice. Because they\\'re both solid as fuck, and will go far in their career. And I want them to remember me as not \"just a SR\", but rather a guy they respect and come to advice. Gotta build relationships like my mentors have built relationships with me.         \\n-- c) Four weeks ago, I had two managers look me in the eye and ask whether a team member should continue being employed. I said no, two days later, he was gone. People far above me *trust* my advice.         \\n-- d) Today, I wake up (I work as a site/systems reliability engineer), drink coffee on my balcony overlooking downtown (and not a shitty suburb filled with \"gangstas\" and immigrants), and grin, and ask myself: \"What cool shit am I going to fuck around with today? What neat problems am I going to solve today?\" I love it.         \\n- Still play video games -- DGAF. It\\'s challenging, entertaining, and this is my life, and I choose how to have fun in it. I\\'ve had a 22 year old girl (with a massive ass, Jesus) call me out on playing ARMA instead of fucking her, and I just cold cut her off. Two weeks later she was sucking my (slightly left-curved) dick. This is my life, I choose how to live it. Video games are fun. I do what I find fun. DGAF. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Pc_tftJQ9M\\n- Above-average social skills. \\n-- a) Picked up chicks relatively regularly from clubs, working on a serious relationship.         \\n-- b) Developed non-creepy relationships with tons of chicks. Don\\'t want to fuck them, but I do know at least one of them wants to fuck me. Nope. Need them for advice, rubber-ducking, not pussy.         \\n-- b) Not only given presentations in front of my company, but COACHED *managers* (I don\\'t manage human beings yet) and Sr. software developers on how to give effective department- and company-wide presentations.         \\n-- c) I\\'ve created, strengthened, and maintained a relationship with two human beings outside of my family who are incredible mentors with respect to my career and personal growth. Their advice and guidance has helped me immensely.        \\n- 240 lbs -- still a bit chubby (6\\'6\"), but I\\'m working on it. Have been steadily making progress for the last 1.5 years. \\n             \\n             \\n             \\n**Self-betterment/fear-conquering is better than women, drugs, suicide, music, food, entertainment, etc.**\\n\\n\\nMy shitty and humble-brag advice. I\\'m 29 years old, and I don\\'t manage humans or make over 100k - so take this (compared to other TRP advice-givers) with a massive grain of salt. \\n\\n\\n- Women are boring. Once you\\'ve been laid a few times ... holy shit, women are like retarded men with pussy. 2/10 women (IMO) are worth talking to beyond getting laid. Granted, 2/10 men are worth talking to at all, but ... when you\\'ve been a virgin for so long, you tend to think women are *the shit*. Nope. They aint\\'. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imgYGfH2yNM \\n- Drugs are an unconstructive way of dealing with problems. If you are addicted to anything - video games, drugs, work, alcohol, weed - you should build a support network to help you handle the problems which are causing you to run away and **not** deal with your problems constructively. You can\\'t do this alone. Nobody is that macho. Nobody has a dick that big. Find mentors. Ask for advice. https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/6b/44/6a/6b446a2ff4f7a70671f5c0b0e1017f83.jpg  \\n- Climb a mountain, and tell no one. Pussies and failures tell other people what they\\'re going to do - esp. on New Year\\'s Day. Men, with a capital M, lose weight, and then casually chat about it with their acquaintances 2.5 years afterward. Talk is cheap. Stop talking, start doing. https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/b7/f4/b0/b7f4b08c072b9df4c86fad0f427e3bee.jpg\\n- Examine your personal and professional relationships, and find out what you\\'re getting from them, and what you\\'re putting into them. \\n-- If you\\'re doing coke and drinking with a bud and you\\'re 18, that\\'s probably fine. \\n-- If you\\'re doing coke and drinking with a bud at 35, and your career is nowhere -- maybe it\\'s time to find new friends who can guide you toward success? \\n-- If your closest friend is a person who is toxic, or is dragging you down -- do you have the courage, at your age, to make new friends? To better yourself? Because it\\'s not all gravy like this post, it\\'s a ton of hard work. \\n- If I had to give 1 piece of advice, that I\\'m 100% sure of, and that I\\'ve ran by my mentors, and people I respect, and strangers, and have seen work in multiple different context, it\\'d be this: **there is no order in the world around us -- we must adapt to the requirements of chaos.** (Kurt Vonnegut, Breakfast of Champions) Stop crying - the world is not supposed to be fair or make sense -- instead: adapt.   \\n             \\nAnyways -- good luck, and thank you TRP.           \\nAdios.          \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an_zUbgwOCQ            \\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hi there people. I wanted to post a quick version of my story so far.\\n\\n**Background**\\nI grew up raised by a single mother. She did her best, and I think I turned out rather well. The lack of masculine figures in my life surely had an impact on me but until I found the red pill I didn't know how much I was missing. I'm 32 now. I found my first girlfriend at 17, married her at 23 and got divorced at 30. No drama involved - we registered our divorce online like we were ordering a pizza. To illustrate how beta I was back then I actually joked at work and said it'd be easy for me to find a new girl because I was already trained well after being with my ex for so long. Almost makes me cringe now.\\n\\nAfter my divorce I got involved with a girl at work who gave me an unwitting baptism in the wonders of female hypergami and all those things known to people who frequent the red pill. I'm glad it was her though. Despite that we had some really good times, and still do but as friends. She was the reason I found the pill. Apart from the pill she's been a tremendous help to me in getting to where I am as she's a very nice person and very intelligent.\\n\\n**Why I'm writing this thanks** A couple of weeks ago I went to an acquaintance of mine's with some friends to watch an event on TV. His girlfriend was there and she couldn't keep her hands off of me, which was a new thing for me.\\n\\nNow this weekend I have 2 girls that are interested in me and want to date me. Both attractive and cute. Having to juggle with that is mind blowing for me. I would never have thought something like that would happen to me, just a year ago, yet here I am.\\n\\nI feel like I've been walking a desert most of my life without knowing it. Now that I'm out of the desert I feel like there was a buffet waiting for me all along.\\n\\n*There's still a lot of work to do, but the ways my life has changed is amazing - thanks everyone!*\",\n",

When alone they gave me the stink eye like a creeper. Saw some dude playing BP game eyeball then then come up and start talking (on the dance floor) . Got shot down straight away.\\n\\nShit tests / frame - lead girl away from her friend to get a drink. After we order She walks off from the bar and starts dancing next to some Chad. I start talking to some other girls at the bar and pay for MY drink. She comes back and grabs her drink, i tell her she needs to pay for it so she does. I see attitude improve after that. Various other verbal shit tests that I had previously A&amp;A'd.\\n\\nLMR - After she walks out of the club says only no I need to say goodbye to my friend. I keep walking her towards the taxi stand as I suggest texting her later.\\n\\nSeal the deal, tell her I have an early morning appointment (I prefer to sleep alone) and she gets a taxi.

My own self-bullshit-belief had been a filter over what was really happening to me (or rather, what I was making happen to me). But it lapsed over the last 5 years because I didn't know anyone taking TRP and I became a pussy in the areas I wanted to do well in. I'm talking panic attacks, depression, insecurity in decisions at work .. I didn't know what I didn't know. \\n\\nI started (and finished) NNMNG last night, fucking cried at my realisations, the bullshit parts of life I'd let drop, saw the reasons why I fucked up so many things, got disgusted at myself, angry at all these missed opportunities and made the decision. I did my breakfree answers and slept at 5am. \\n\\nToday, I need a job. I've been applying for jobs the last 2 months in a supplicating way and never got a call back. \\n\\nToday I saw a job that's above me but I wanted it. I'd missed the cutoff by 6 hours and no chance. I called the company but the agent wasn't answering, the receptionist said it was already cut off and told me it was too late.\\n\\nFuck it, I decided I'll email him anyway and not use the online submission form. I wrote out my email and went to make a coffee, then the RP hit. Advice from MRP Mods washed over me, so I rewrote the subject as *Bill, I'm late but I'm awesome* and wrote the cover letter like I had already earned the job.\\n\\nThe agent called me within the hour and told me he will present me for the job, they can only put 2 candidates forward and I was one of them. I also negotiated a rate higher than I'd ever had before.\\n\\nFuck yeah!\\n\\nI'm still a noob with a long way to go, but this is what it's all about.\\n\\nThanks TRP.\",\n",

He will  continue to try and fathom the whole deal for a very very very long time to know where he went wrong.

       "  'selftext': '\\nPreface\\nCollege was an atypical experience for me, at the time of this story I was a 32 year old junior engineering major who had devoted the first 8 years of his adult life to the United States Marine Corps.  I made my bones part time driving a propane powered forklift around a warehouse and stacking 80+lb hardwood pallets.  I also did other odd jobs on the side.  I fell victim to the economy at the time and after buying too much house  I had to rent out rooms to hold the mortgage down….or face the grim reality of turning off all the utilities and cooking/heating with the fireplace to save money to avoid the possibly of foreclosure.  Most of my time was devoted to school because my limited GI bill required me to take very heavy course loads if I wanted to complete my engineering degree before running out of benefits.  The rest of my time was spent driving between work, class and home, doing homework, trying to keep my house from falling down, and figuring out if I could afford two slices of bread on my next sandwich.  When I had a sliver of free time I spent it wrenching on my jeep or meditating. Keep in mind when I started attending tech school I stopped giving a fuck about how I dressed, I routinely showed up to class in nasty-ass work boots, ripped jean, multiple sweaters (my workplace was not climate controlled) , and a winter hat.  I usually slept in my car between classes and I rarely trimmed my beard.  The exhaust aroma of my 10,000lb capacity propane powered forklift permeated my clothes.  \\n\\nFirst Contact:\\n\\nThe first day of class of my junior semester involves lots of typical college shit: trying to find your next class while fist bumping all your dude bros you haven’t seen since last semester’s post-final drinking binge.  Checking out the soon-to-be-impregnated-freshman-coeds while lining up the coming weekend’s good times.  Then I spotted this absolute goddess standing in the hall near the door of my next class. This girl was a solid 9.5: Blond hair, at least 6 feet tall, thin waist, perfect tan, ribs you could see, long legs, not an ounce of fat on her body and a huge set of tits.   She was wearing simple country-ish clothes: white wife beater type top, shorts, and flip flops; but she wore it like a Versace dress.  She was very well kept and done up to the nines: not a thread, strand of hair or piece of jewelry was out of place.  Her skin had zero blemishes, no visible moles, bruise etc. She sported perfect French manicure/pedicure and a set of diamond earrings, and a huge rock on the ring finger of her left hand.  She could have easily stepped out of the pages of playboy, hustler, penthouse or any modeling website.  Everything about this girl was pretty, including her asshole.  I had heard about her, many said she was the hottest girl to ever grace the hallways of this miserable tech school.  Girls are not a common occurrence at tech schools, let alone girls this hot.  You ever see a shark swim through a school of fish or can you imagine Moses parting the red sea?  That is the treatment this girl got in the hallway.  The nerdy IT major Betas would deliberately advert there gaze not to look at her, like seeing a hot girls would turn them to stone or something.   Even the “Alpha jocks” would quicken their pace and uncomfortably walk by her without making eye contact.   Bodies ebbed and flowed down the hallway but everyone gave her a wide berth.  (Think of the scene in “planet  Z” when all the zombies run right past  the cancer patient because he is an unworthy host and you get the idea). This girl was so hot no one would talk to her and I could immediately tell she was miserable, lonely and incredibly bored.   Rumor had it some rich sugar daddy had locked her down and she was on his payroll.   She did have a huge ring on her left ring finger, but I’m an asshole, so time to go in for the kill and engage her (to the best of my memory this is how I opened)\\n\\nMe(stepping way too far into her personal space before she can see me) :  “Excuse me! If two midgets are at a party they are going to talk, do you think the same goes for two incredibly attractive tall people in a hallway while they wait on class to start?” (Cocked my head, shit eating grin, did not break eye contact)\\n\\nSloot: (face lights up, huge smile, immediately ignores phone) : yes I think s…\\nMe: (interrupting her) Gurrll..you have to put that ring away! that thing in blinding me! Somebody must love you to give you that!\\n\\nSloot: Oh this? (Flashes ring in front of her face) it’s nothing. (Moves face closer to me) I’m not supposed to tell anyone this (laughs) but it cost 38K.. and he…he…is…. ok. \\nMe (interrupting her again) Honey, whatever you say just don’t punch me with that thing on, cause it’s bigger than some brass knuckles I’ve seen.    I’m sure I would need stiches on this manly mug. \\n\\nSloot: I’m not like that..I mean I’m not violent…\\nWe bantered some more, I never broke eye contact, the conversation shifter to money, she kept causally bringing up the cost of her upkeep: mani/pedi cure, hair etc.  All of a sudden everything she talked about revolved around $$...so I called her out: \\n\\nMe: (interrupting her yet again) are you sure you’re not some superficial money grubbing gold digger?\\n\\nSloot: (starting to lose it) I’m sure I am not! \\n\\nMe: you seem sincere, I guess you’re telling the truth (AWALT) just so you know I don’t put up with that kind of shit. \\n\\nSloot:  (backpedaling hard) I’m not like that I swear! \\nBell rings, people start walking into class with a quickness,\\n\\nSloot: want to sit together?\\n\\nMe: (slightly annoyed) I’m not that easy … maybe later\\n\\nI filed into class, she sat next to some chubby chick who was a solid three, making her a 8 by tech school standards. I sat two rows over and behind her, next to a dude-bro. \\nSo on the 3rd day of class we had to break up into pre-assigned groups to finish a class project, she was in my group.  We assembled in a breakout room and assigned tasks, we also exchanged phone numbers. I got her number- the trap is set….I one day in class I started getting board.  I look over at her and she is zoned out.  I whip out my phone and text her something like “Can you believe the ego this professor has?  Anymore of this and I’m going to vomit….BTW love the shirt cutie pie…”  I hit send and I watch as the vibrating phone snaps her out of her stupor.  She fiddles with her phone and reads my message.  Her face lights up like a Christmas tree.  She starts scanning the room for the person who sent the text.  I immediately look away.  After 5 seconds I can feel her staring at me, so I give it another 10 seconds and then look her way.  She is smiling so wide I think her face is going to break.  I hold her gaze and make a finger gun with my hand, point it at her and drop the hammer, then return her smile.  She points at her phone, I nod and she starts texting me back.   That was the beginning of a semester long text conversation, I was always in control, I ended conversation by not texting back, waited longer between replies etc.  Through our texts I started to get a glimpse of this girl’s life.  She is a runway model,  Her boyfriend’s parents were obscenely rich, and allowed her to live in the family mansion as long as she and BB sleep in separate bedrooms. She was allowed to pick a car out of the family stable to drive, and a shell company of the parents was paying her tuition. Instead of being grateful she harbored a secret loathing for her situation and constantly attempted to complain about BB to me.   One text I got was a picture of a fountain at a Vegas casino, and a message that read “We are in Vegas, here is a picture for you.  Guess who just lost over 8K at the blackjack table? Such a dumb-ass!  Who hits on a 10?” Another time He used the company helicopter to fly her to dinner at some fancy restaurant downtown.  She complained more “He is not a smooth pilot and does not have steady hands.  He didn’t wait until the blades stopped spinning to open the helicopter door so the wind from the blades messed up my hair.  I had to sit in the restaurant looking like trash” \\n\\nHalfway through the semester our group is in the breakout room working on our project. During a lull in the conversation we start discussing our plans for the night.  When it gets to her she says, “me and some friends are going to club x tonight.”  Then she meekly adds “You can come along if you want.”  Her voice trailing off at the end of the statement showing some insecurity.  I impolitely declined.  The jaws of everyone in the room dropped, including hers.  I’m pretty sure no man had ever said no to her, let alone refused an invite for a night out.    I didn’t think much of it, but everyone else did. The tension hung heavy in the air and everyone was speechless. \\nA few days later I was sitting at an outdoor table in the campus café doing homework and wondering if purchasing a sandwich would cut into this week’s gas money.    I feel the table shift and realized someone is about to sit down with me.  I looked up to see her with a fresh hair do, wearing clothes more revealing than usual but still looking classy.  She sits down and starts talking to me.  I do not remember the exact details of the conversation but she was trying to figure out why I shot her down without coming out and asking it. She did vaguely talk about guys in a way that made me believe she was trying to figure out if I was gay.  I forget exactly how I countered this but I know I handled it well and with my regular funny/cocky/make you laugh kinda shit.   She did ask me if I had a GF, and I said I did but we were about to break up.  She asked me if my GF knew the breakup was coming and I said no.  She knowingly chuckled to which I replied”What? I told you I’m an asshole!”  I also threw some antidotes in that hinted many girls were interested in me.  Now she knows I’m not gay, confirmed I have a high SMV, and that since I have a GF someone can put up with my shit, the paradigm has shifted, she is pursuing me.  A week later I end up breaking it off with my GF who did not take things so well.  I texted the Sloot and said something along the lines of “Why do girls turn into stalkers? I mean WTF why can’t she leave me alone my dick isn’t that big” \\nFast forward to finals week.  The final project is turned in, and its exam time.  I’m a good test taker so I’m done with the test with a quickness.  Out of the corner of my eye is see her watching me.  As soon as she realizes I’m done, she starts scribbling down answers with reckless abandon, gathers her books and turn in her test.  I hear her footsteps behind me, and she runs up behind me and grabs my arm.  \\nSloot: “ Hey lets go look at my car!” \\nMe: “Now, Really?”\\nSloot: “Yes!” \\n\\nShe proceeds to drag me across campus towards the parking lot.  We walk past a group of mechanical engineering students smoking and joking outside the ME building, most of which are at least 10 years my junior.  All of them are either giving me the stink eye, looks of confusion, or like I’m some sort of minor god.  One of them whom I talked to frequently (a jock type who also thought his shit didn’t stink) gave me the funniest look ever.  He could not comprehend why the hottest girl in school was dragging a 32 year old veteran across campus by the hand while ignoring Mr. Jock and his crew. I pointed my finger gun at him, dropped the hammer and smiled.  \\nIt was obvious at this point she wanted to show me more than the car, all of what I got to see was nice.    \\n\\nEnd Sinister\\nWe texted a few times between semesters, lined up what classes we had together, flirted etc.  First day of class I got a text from her stating she would not be at school and asking me to take notes for her.  To which I replied “What’s in it for me?”  She sent back a “;-)”.  The next day I’m in the school bookstore and I get a call from her and I can’t answer.  I assumed she was having car trouble so when I was done at the bookstore I called and left a message along the lines of “are you ok you’re going to owe me big if I have to change a flat tire.”  Phone rings a minute later, its beta bux on her phone.  He tells me not to call this number again, threatens my life, and informs me his parents are rich and he can make life miserable for me. He is trying to sound like a bad ass and he is not convincing me.  I responded by telling him I raped men bigger than him in prison, and I hung up.  The third day of class she finally shows up and she is broken.  Her roots are showing, (her dye job was so perfect no one ever knew she was a natural brunette). Her manicure was peeling, her clothes were dirty and she looked like she had been sleeping in her car while skipping meals.   Guess Sugar daddy cut the purse strings and bounced her out on her ass pretty hard.  I attempted to talk to her and she went on to say BB himself was a passive aggressive pussy, but he “knew people” and I needed to watch my back.  Last words we ever spoke. Black knight mission complete, no fucks to give. \\n\\nAftermath\\nI graduated in 2009 with engineering degree and three other fancy titles behind my name.   I took a voluntary lay-off from my warehouse job shortly after graduating and used this time to get my head right in matters involving my dad’s departure from this mortal coil.  Shortly after I got my first “real” engineering job, a year later my second, both places called me the best engineer they ever had.  Now my current employer is fast-tracking me to engineering management.  I’m renting out my old pad and bought another one twice as big, this one has a game room and a beer machine. My project jeep has now won some awards at a few car shows.  I spin plates that are easily 10-15 years younger than me, all in all I’m very happy. Sometime when I get bored I google her name and three things come up: a picture of her on the runway in some expensive dress, one of her ads with her posing next to some nice car, and a picture of her with her new 50 something sugar daddy who is a mover and shaker in the It field.  Evidentially she stayed in school after her BA and started towards a Masters in IT management or some shit.  All to be some old dude’s mattress….I never got a beat down from BB or his “friends” Turns out he scooped up a beer tub girl from a local country showcase to use as his new live in mattress. \\n\\nTRP Lessons learned:\\nReally pretty girls are still super insecure.  Especially the models, because they are constantly compared to other girls in all sorts of ways, and feel like they are one Twinkie away form a nutty-professor style butt explosion that will cost them all future modeling gigs. Exploit this insecurity! \\nLots of guys will not approach super-hot girls – have the guts to approach them enough said\\n AWALT/AFBB – This rich beta gave her everything: cars to drive, free tuition, place to stay, expensive trips etc.  She still complained about beta and chased the tall muscular tattooed guy who proved he had SMV and also proved he had no fucks to give.  \\nGame and confidence can make up for a lot -  I dressed like shit, was ten years older than everyone else in college and still pulled this off. \\n\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Tl;dr A textbook Nice guy realized what he was doing wrong and found happiness for the first time since childhood.\\n\\nImagine a guy who wants to be nice to everyone. A guy so nice, he would sacrifice his happiness so that he would not offend people around him. He had many friends who took advantage of him. Meanwhile, he had a secret life. A life where he felt like shit. A life where he knew he is not good enough. A life where he masturbated once or twice a day to different kinds of porn. The type of porn got weirder day by day. Let us call this guy Raj.\\n\\nLuckily, one fine day Raj found out that he has problems with porn. He realized that he’s using porn as a drug. He started searching in Internet about the bad effects of porn. He came across a video about it in youtube. In this video, the orator mentions about a certain sub in reddit.com where people who has problems with porn problem find “cure”. \\n\\nTedx: The great Porn expiriment by Gary Wilson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU\\n\\nInspired by this video, Raj starts a NoFap challenge. After some relapses, he succeeds and quits porn and masturbation for over 6 months. In the meantime, he starts Lifting, Running and Meditating. Raj’s life gets a dramatic turn. He knows that he is unhappy in his life. But, he is not sure what is causing this unhappiness. He realizes that one of the reasons is that his financial dependency on his Parents. He cannot do much about it since he is still in College. He concentrates more on studies and starts preparing for interviews in future.\\n\\nRaj is in great shape now. Many girls around him are showing interest in him. He is finding it easy to get into a relationship. But, for some strange reason none of the relationships last. Everytime this happens, Raj goes into depression. He has so many friends who are girls. Raj has crush on some of them. But, nearly all of them have friendzoned him. Raj doesn’t understand this. He thinks, “I am such a nice guy. Why don’t have a nice girlfriend. It happens all the time in movies?”. Raj comes across a post in NoFap subreddit which says “Nice guys fap a lot, and don’t get laid. Here’s why”: http://archive.is/NFlRB\\n\\nRaj realizes that he is one of the nice guys(Bill) described in this book. He starts the breakfree exercises mentioned in the book and feels much better. Raj now realizes that the source of his unhappiness is his people pleasing habit. Raj gradually changes this habit and concentrates on his preferences and goals. He looses few friends but he gains some genuine ones. He posts on NoFap thanking the person who introduced him to the book. Some random user recommends TheRedPill to Raj. Raj is curious about red pill. Ohh, I have forgot to mention. Raj loves reading. He reads the sidebar, the red pill handbook, The book of Pook, The Rational male, The 48 Laws of power, etc. Raj is astonished, he cannot believe what he is reading. However, on the other hand so many things starts making sense to him now.  \\n\\nRaj is already in good shape thanks to NoFap challenge. His anxiety problems are gone thanks to NoFap again. He has recently got an amazing job (His dream job). He is meditating. He is no longer affected by emotional manipulations of his mom. He has great buddies. He starts applying what he learnt in trp. He distances himself from most of his girl-friends. He stops taking girls on coffee/walk/dinner dates. He takes them to action dates, escalates as quickly as he can and go for the lay. He takes care that he is not emotionally attached to any girl now. \\n\\nHe has also realized that he should stop whining about his problems and start working on them. People want to be friends with him now. People respect him at his work place. His life is changed for good. He is clear about his goals in life. More importantly, Raj feels like a man now!\\n\\nThank you TRP!\\nThank you Pook!',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Since junior year of high school I've been suicidal. I was a pothead who never took any sort of responsibility for myself and my lack of happiness. I looked for the miracle drug that would magically solve all of my problems. I took acid, mushrooms, ecstasy, and, of course, they all only made things worse. And, of course, girl problems. I had only had sex once in my life as of last year. I have an absolutely horrible reputation when it comes to women at my school.\\n\\nAt my lowest point, I stumbled on TRP. It was everything I already knew, but never could articulate. I began to see the world, myself, and my family in a new light. I knew that I didn't respect my father, but I never knew why until now. I began to understand what it takes to be a man. I hit the gym, made massive gains in all of my lifts, quit drugs, read NMMNG and Models, joined a frat, and started approaching. I'm still learning game, but I've already hooked up with a chick this year and I know that if I push through then my progress will continue and I will make myself the man that I want to be.\\n\\nI know that I have incredible amounts of work to do and I still revert to only suicidal thought patterns from time to time, but now I have the power to give myself a hard (metaphorical) slap in the face, pull my shoulders back, and stick my chin up in the air. The negative self-talk is now the fuel that powers my journey. I am empowered to fight through the shitty reputation, friends who don't respect me, girls who think I'm creepy, and everything else that is in my way. I know that while everything is my fault, life is completely fair, and that hard work is the way to being saved.\\n\\nThank you for all of the slaps on the face, the cynicism that I identify with, the no-bullshit atmosphere.\\n\\nI'm worthless, but I am building something. I deserve no love, but I will earn it. I've lost friends because I respect myself. I am a work horse, a soldier. I get no rewards.\\n\\nThank you TRP\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Fist of, english is not my first language, so pardon me for any grammatical mistakes. I\\'m gonna keep this as short as I can. \\n\\nI cut contact with my mom when I was 16, due to me having enough of all her bullshit - alcoholism, abuse, lies, broken promises, laziness - what pulled the last straw was her refusing to pay me back for a loan, and making a scene in a public cafe, embarrassing the fuck out of me. I walked out on her and haven\\'t talked to her since (I\\'m 21 now). Ever since, I\\'ve been speculating whether I was being too hard on her, but I keep coming back to the conclusion, that no. I was absolutely fucking not too hard on her.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nA couple of months before I was born, my parents got divorced, after five years of marriage. My dad was a doctor and a lawyer, and lived in a big ass mansion out of town. He was 42 when he married my mom, who was 25. He died last year of a heart attack.\\n\\nMy mom was literally nothing else but pretty back in the day. She had a few different degrees, but she never seemed to use them once she moved on her own, after the divorce: it went all downhill from there. Lost one job after the other, we had to move often, and every year just got worse, with a worse job and a smaller apartment. She dated tons of different men, would often invite complete strangers into our home, and began drinking uncontrollably. Throughout my childhood I was known in school as the smelly kid, because my clothes always smelled of cigarettes and alcohol. I was also late very often, due to lack of sleep, because my mom would often host parties on school nights. I mean, what the fuck!\\n\\nWhen I was 12 I was abused my one of her boyfriends. He was very violent towards her and even fucking sent her to the hospital a few times a year, leaving him and I alone at home. After some time had went by, she finally sued him, but dropped the case later on because he had \"changed\". This happened *several* times, and it was still going on and off last I saw her, with a few other relationships going on at the same time as well...\\n\\n\\nI hardly knew my dad at the time, \\'cause my mother would give me a shit-ton of guilt every time I went to his place to visit. I was very loyal to her, as she kept on filling me up with how good a mother she was and how hard she was working, so often when it was time for me to visit my dad, I\\'d stay home with my mom instead, because I thought it was the right thing to do. We\\'d then watch movies together and she\\'d buy loads of candy for us, as a form of reward... \\n\\nI never quite understood why she wanted to have a child with a guy she despised so much. He seemed fine to me, a BB seen in retrospect, but a calm and friendly, and stable, person to me as a kid, nonetheless. Although my mom\\'s completely worn out now, she was fairly attractive back after the divorce: she could have probably met a nice dude and start the family she always wanted, I thought. So why settle on the one guy she couldn\\'t stand? \\n\\nI think it\\'s because she wanted to secure that sweet, sweet child-support every month for the next, presumably, 18 years. Don\\'t get me wrong, she did want children - but why give birth to the child of a man you \"hate\", when you could easily attract any other poor beta around the block? Because my dad was rich and stupid. So she planned for the divorce, got knocked up, then filed the divorce, and has since milked him every month. \\n\\n\\nI did end up moving out to my dad\\'s when I was 15, because my mom simply hadn\\'t enough money to support both of us, and after that, my life got gradually better. Dad had a new lady, who he didn\\'t marry, who I to this day consider more of a mother to me than my biological mom. She owned her own company and worked from home. She would always be there, always happy to talk with me, play computer games with me, teach me how to cook, and gladly act like the bridge between me and my dad as we were still getting to know each other. She and my dad would never drink in front of me, and the home was always peaceful and quiet, with a lot of space for each of us, which meant the world for me, since I was growing up to be quite the over-sensitive introvert. My dad and I never really bonded, though: we had very different views on what I was going to do with my life, and I felt pretty smothered by him in the end, but that\\'s okay. We had our moments, anyway.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nI live in the other end of the country now, so I hardly see any of my family anymore - which I appreciate. Stepmom understands and keeps her distance. These days I do well as a freelance illustrator, and work part-time in a gaming store, which pays well and the boss is pretty relaxed - I basically get to pick my own working hours, so that\\'s great. I have a nice apartment and I\\'m fit and healthy. I only hope I won\\'t end up the same as my mother.\\n\\nEvery month there\\'s plus on my bank account and I overall just feel so relieved that my childhood is finally over, and that I have control over my life now. I found you people through my boyfriend, and it was such an eye-opener to me. I feel like I finally understand why all these things happened, finally understand my mom a little better, and now I can finally move on a little more. So thanks a lot, guys. Lots of love from Denmark. Don\\'t stick your dick in crazy.\\n\\nEdit: formatting.',\n",

I\\'m proud of my transformation, and hope it might show others what they can do if they stick to it.\\n\\nWhen I found the Red Pill, it was at about 14k subscribers, and I was about halfway through High School. I was in a relationship with a fairly attractive girl for my age, and had been with her for a year and a half without any sexual contact. I was on the wrestling team at a very light weight, and was a benchwarmer on our school\\'s football team.\\n\\nI had begun getting frustrated by the fact that nothing was the way I wanted it to be in life, specifically with my relationship. It had been coming up on two years, and I had put my hands down her pants maybe once. I was a little faggot who cried after being turned down trying to finger my LTR at that time.\\n\\n**November 2013**\\n\\nI began googling how to get better with \\'sex stuff\\' and turning to the internet to understand what the fuck to do. (I had no parents to teach me what to do, so the internet was my defacto response to everything). On some reddit thread on AskReddit about sex, someone linked \"/r/theredpill\" as a joke or something, curious, I clicked.\\n\\nFast forward three months, I had a gym membership. I began learning social skills to actually talk to people. I dropped out of football to seriously pursue wrestling. I broke up with my girlfriend after confronting her about our sex life. I began forming opinions and listening to music, and dropped my CSE nerd friends that were holding me back.\\n\\n**Six months post-swallow**, I had been reading lots of psychology books, game books, blogs, documentaries, and finally I discovered Models by Mark Manson. I was truly on the path of the Red Pill, and the *anger phase* was full swing.\\n\\n----\\n\\nThere was a lot that happened in between, but that\\'s not what this is about. I have been following the Red Pill ideology in quiet for years now without telling anyone. High school ended on a great note, and I got accepted into a school I loved and desired.\\n\\nI am now in my second year of college, and am studying Cognitive Neuroscience as my major, on track to grad school for my PHD. I am simultaneously on the last month stretch before my first Bodybuilding competition, which I feel confident about. \\n\\nI have a lay count higher than any of my friends, have completely come to closure about Religion, and am working on creating a nonprofit education initiative with funding from my University. I am also on the presidential board of multiple student organizations but still go out multiple times a week.\\n\\n\\n----\\n\\nThe road of the red pill is not the easiest, and will never be over. If you put in the hard work, it WILL pay off, but it also WILL fucking suck for a long while. I\\'m proud of where I am today, and I know I\\'m not done. I have been giving back to the Red Pill community, though it is not carrying as powerful of a message as it once was in my opinion. \\n\\nI have taken so many risks to get to this point, I have failed many times over, been hospitalized for various things thanks to this lifestyle, and gone through even harder heartbreak than what got me into TRP.\\n\\nAll in all, I fully credit the ideals of the Red Pill community for putting me where I am today. \\n\\n(Also, I smoke a lot of weed. Being high isn\\'t an excuse to not improve)',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"TL;DR: 25 year old male living abroad has spent a year waking up to the truth after a catastrophic, toxic friendship with a girl from college went up in flames. While he is still far from where he wants to be, he is on his way there.\\n\\nUp until a year ago I drank all the SJW/Feminist kool aid I could possibly get my hands on. I grew up in a place that promotes PC culture (it might as well be renamed 'cuckistan'). To add to it, I had a very abusive mother growing up, who would beat me and have absolute control over my life. I took no responsibility for my actions and I believed I was entitled to everything under the sun. \\n\\nThen, it happened.\\n\\nI befriended someone in University and the friendship developed into a deep on. I believed her to be my best friend. Little did I know that I was being taken advantage of and it had all the tropes of 'friend zone' hijinks. \\n\\nI won't go into further detail, but the friendship deteriorated. She broke up with her bf, started dating someone else, I started feeling funny when she was PDAing it up in my face (not excusable, just an explanation), and at the end she ended up turning really nasty. The full story can be found below.\\n\\nhttp://archive.is/Iw7Ok\\n\\nShe taught me a very valuable lesson, one that I had refused to learn for quite a while because I believed in maintaining a moral high ground and putting the greater good before self-preservation.\\n\\nShe also taught me that female friendships are worthless at best and toxic at worst. \\n\\nI decided from that point to take action. I started hitting the gym at a more regular pace (I went sporadically before), I decided to pay more attention to what I was eating (it's gotten to a point where I get excited about eating a kale salad!). I've even tried a few new things, including doing a few open mics at the local comedy club to work on my wit and my courage.\\n\\nI also had to make several hard choices. One of which was to close to border of friendships to women until I figure out what the hell is going on. Does this mean I am nasty to all the women I meet now? Absolutely not. Does this mean I proactively avoid women wherever I go? No. Some of my new friends (who are absolutely amazing) have gfs of their own and we get on quite nicely. I work with several female co-workers. So if you're a woman and the SO of someone I hold hear, or someone I maintain a professional relationship with, you're ok. Just understand that there'll still be an arm's length between us.\\n\\nI am more selective with my time, which is an extremely precious resource. I used to languish in bars, not understanding the girl I was hoping to score with had chosen someone else. But nowadays, if there isn't something that stands to benefit me, I gtfo of where I am going and go somewhere that there is.\\n\\nThere haven't been many results, unfortunately. I am a lot more balanced with my thinking (as opposed to the mental wreck I was before). I have lost a significant amount of weight. And I have purged my life of most of its toxicity (male or female). My time and friendship is no longer freely given, it its earned.\\n\\nBut I am still single, and I still am without a girlfriend, which is what I want. But I have a date in the next few days, and while I am keeping my expectations balanced, I understand that I am in a much better place than I was before.\\n\\nThey journey, as they say, goes on.\\n\\nThank you.\",\n",

This group of girls, using my TRP knowledge, I never texted them \"just to talk\" as that is an act of a beta and I even successfully defused a shit-test along the way.\\n\\n**Tonight:** I had my first success tonight, getting my first kiss with a girl. I made out with this girl looking out over a near by city from a cliff. She actually led me to the spot and she was giving signs but I wasn\\'t sure whether to go for it (I was waiting for the \"perfect time\" that never comes) until I said fuck it and nutted up to make a move. It was fucking great and got me really hyped and inflated my ego a bit but I couldn\\'t go all the way because I was cockblocked by my curfew. Oh well, I might hit her up later this week for something a little more but I\\'ll play that by ear.\\n\\nThank you TRP, I have much to learn but I have grown so much from this community.',\n",

Without them, I would not have found the passion to live life to the fullest. I have accidentally stumbled upon this subreddit while i was watching the anime called: Welcome to the NHK. I felt truly ashamed that I can relate to the main protagonist that i literally google the phrase: \"How not to become a loser\" Laughable, I know.  To my surprise, google has linked me to the post \"How to stop being a loser in life\"  by the99percent1. Curious, I read all the top posts and also the sidebar. I\\'ve felt that I discovered something that I should\\'ve known the day I was born, or maybe I did and i have forgotten because of feminism. In any case, I thank TRP again for the drive that I was looking for. I now have a goal in life, where previously I was just the typical happy-go-lucky chump. I now consistently lift weights, improve my social interactions, learn a new language and other things that i find interesting and necessary. I just wanted to post because it is almost a month since i swallowed the pill and there is so much more to do. Thank you again and again.',\n",

I'm in an LTR with a girl who I think I'm going to keep for a while at least. We had been having sex for a few months now and it wasn't going very well. I'm not very well endowed and I didn't know what I was doing. Usually would only last a few mins and I'd be lucky if she came once. After reading TRP I became very much inspired if you will to try some things. I started talking to her like I cares less, didn't ask her if she wanted stuff I just did things and told her to do things. At first she resisted but now she cools for me every time I come over and is more submissive. The sex got way better as well. I was way more dominant and pulled her hair scratched her etc and went hard and fast and before I knew it an hour had gone by, she had cummed about five times and I wasn't even close yet. I even told her that it was normal for girls to have rape fantasies and despite being reluctant at first she now wants to act that out (consensually of course). She wants me all the time and begs for sex or even the chance to blow me (before she refused) It's true women want to be controlled by a high status alpha.

Also quit my job and will quit my continent soon to start a new life. I post in this subreddit as I just opened my account.\\n\\nLong:\\nI am socially Red as I lift very regularly, confident, able to be very social/funny and leader of the pack in lots of situation. I have a good salary, a nice flat and able to burn money when needed. But I was completely blue with girls. I even voluntarily stopped seeing plates 2 years ago because I wanted something \"more serious\": I stopped completely to fuck, I became a first class orbiter, I even did with knight things and then I moved into monk mode with few poor tries with meeting websites. I even cried in the arm of my orbit-mistress. Don\\'t throw up please.\\n\\nI had only two lucky fucks in two years after years of regularly porno-level fucks with naughty girls. Fucking like porn in real life permanently disturbed my sex needs. I don\\'t recommend to experiment porn-level sex because you will always seek for this level of excitation and sadly not all the girls will rim you, suck you like a slimy Dyson, let you pull their hair and let you crush their head on the pillow while destroying their pussy. But I digress.\\n\\nBeing bulky is not enough if you are socially awkward with girls or don\\'t know their game.\\n\\nAfter lots of TRP reading, I started to let grow my hairs (I used to cut them short), doing more social activities to have something to speak about (concerts, museums, small travels, reading, sporty week-ends...), stopped t-shirts and started wearing shirts. I also quit my job and found an other one in another nice continent/country (yeah, I am going full auto to change my status, thanks to TRP). And I started reading girls.\\n\\nI am friend/half-orbiter with one of my female colleague. We are close, but I was blue with her, she is in a stable relation and she is a young mother. My changes immediately triggered her: \"you are beautiful, you look like a real men, are you seeing a girl ? I NEED to present you Julia, she is so funny and also want to move to your next city !\".\\n\\nJulia has a low SMV, she is a 6.5 on nice FB/instagram pictures but more close to 5-6 in real life. A bit chubby for European standards (she is thin for USA standards).\\nRed flag: lots of tatoos, nose ring, party girl and don\\'t even like metal. WTF. She is funny and friendly at least.\\n\\nBut let\\'s meet her, it will be my first girl to try TRP in real life and I don\\'t give a damn. I need to start somewhere if I want to put my sausage somewhere.\\n\\nOnly few text messages over the week-end with long hours between them, I didn\\'t ask if she was available and set a meeting. She was not available so when she proposed an other day, I didn\\'t accepted yet but shoot \"I\\'ll get back to you tomorrow\" with the intention of not texting her. And she was the first to recontact me: first achievement unlocked. Then I organized the meeting without asking anything.\\n\\nI did lots of mistakes during the date but as my SMV was way more higher than hers it was not a big deal to finish with my tongue in her mouth. She removed my hand from her legs but whatever.\\n\\nWhat I did good:\\n\\n- Regularly reminded myself that I don\\'t want to be friend with her but to fuck her. You need to force this thought very regularly, it forces you to remind you of TRP. Especially when you are a deep blue (like me).\\n\\n- Do not let her think she is a queen, treat her like a child. I threw some objects at her, diminished her (in a funny way) a few times. Told her when her stories were boring.\\n\\n- Keep frame: MOST IMPORTANT PART. I acted like I was all the time confident, didn\\'t sorry myself to take a piss, ordered drinks &amp; food without hesitation, acted friendly with bartenders and waiters. Made everything obvious that the situation is normal, not awkward. A bubble of trust around both of us.\\n\\n- Shit-tests: keeping frame helped me a lot to kill instantly small shit tests. When I started to do very light kino she switched the conversation to her native language (I speak it but with a very poor accent - she knows it and I made fun of myself about that without loosing frame), I naturally answered in my language, she tried to insist a bit but stopped after one more try and got over it. I started to caress her neck and we soon kissed.\\n\\n- Lift. She felt my body, my arms and said \"hmmm, muscled...\".\\n\\n- Style. Nice shoes, pant and shirt. And a watch. Get a watch. I\\'ve got a nice watch, I assure you my interlocutors always look at it.\\n\\n- I was endorsed by her friend, a girl.\\n\\n- Once I am in the state of kiss or fuck with a girl, I am naturally confident and dominant, so it came back instantaneously. Let her feel your hard meat, she loves it.\\n\\nWhat I did wrong:\\n\\n- Few moments of silence, but I managed them with frame.\\n\\n- I could have easily tried to get back to her flat as she gave me elements to work on. I\\'m still very blue, don\\'t forget it.\\n\\n- Forgot a lot to repeat to myself TRP mantras during the date. I dated low so my errors were not fatal, but it is very easy to do blue things when you loose track. Force yourself to think about TRP principles while speaking to her.\\n\\n- I spoke one time about an ex-girlfriend. I don\\'t know if it\\'s good or bad.\\n\\n- waited to long to escalate (talk &amp; kino)\\n\\nI only texted her one time before setting a new plan (dining at my flat) without asking her permission and with a joke. She answered with a funny answer to the joke, I assume it\\'s yes.\\n\\nIt is not an impressive FR, but as a brand new TRP reader, reading FR from noobs helped me a lot to process things.\\n\\nAgain, as everyone else on TRP, I am saying TRP is working like you can\\'t even imagine. The day I started to reprocess all my behaviors and social interactions everybody started to ask me questions ( \"did you find a girlfriend ? Why are you so happy today ?...\") and showed interest in me.\\nWithin one month I made strong choices, destroyed my easy life for a new challenge on another ocean side, stopped porn. I found easily several jobs. I was already confident at work interviews but TRP gave me more tips to perform better.\\n\\nRead TRP, again and again, start low, get small results and escalate. And change your life if you don\\'t like it, nothing will come if you are waiting without breaking your bad patterns. Read TRP again. And Lift for strength. Start to lift now, your body will be ready for D-Day. TRP is the best thing I found on internet (after Efukt).\\n\\nThanks TRP !',\n",

Except he treated me even worse, it went from him ignoring me to play video games and watch Twitch, to him boasting about throwing a soda can away and demanding I 'fetch him another.' Seems he took only some of it to heart. So I moved on, me being the main breadwinner of the home. He is homeless now and I am with a gorgeous lesbian. I would have never realized my sexuality if it wasn't for his failure to be a man. In fact, I have more success since abandoning him. I make more money, the sex is better, and I don't have to pretend to be mommy for any more guys. Thank you RP for making me realize I didn't need a man in my life, but rather a woman. A beautiful, sexual, fun, and loving woman, who will be my wife soon. I've never been happier. I love you Sofia.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Last year my girlfriend broke up with me. I had oneitis and thought she was the love of my life. After the breakup I wrote her a 10 page handwritten letter to explain how much I loved her during our relationship, how I will try to improve my life for her, blablabla (major BP stuff). Couldn't get myself to send the letter yet so I put it somewhere safe in my room. Got really depressed and didn't want to leave the house. Couldn't sleep, my heart was pounding, and having this condition called 'Pectus Excavatum' (where the breast bone grows into your chest) made it even worse. Started watching Dragon Ball Z  to cheer me up (this later led to me discovering TRP and hence my name)\\n\\nAll in all I was a gaming addict, fast food eating bluepill with nothing to live for.\\n\\nA few weeks later I found out she jumped into the next relationship within a few days after our relationship ended (our relationship took 2 years), not to mention with the (alpha) coworker she thought was awesome. When this news hit me it broke me even more, cried my eyes out to the point where there were no more tears. Parents said something along the lines of 'Don't worry other girls will come'. But I felt like I would never have any hope again. How could she do this to me, after all the sweet things she said to me? How could she have betrayed me like this, I never did anything wrong to her... At this point I didn't know if I had more anger, hatred or sadness. Confidence was at an all time low.\\n\\nAfter crying for hours I wanted to 'cool off' and decided to take a really cold shower. The cold didn't bother me and I just stood there thinking. I will never forget what happened next: I started thinking about Dragon Ball Z since I had been watching it alot. Vegeta was one of the main characters I looked up to and my blue pill anime mind started to fantasize about what Vegeta would've done. His whole race dead, not attaining super saiyan status first, always being pushed back but it never made him quit or back down. When things didn't go his way he reviewed his past actions and decided to become even stronger by working even harder. As I stood there with cold water running down my body, I started to resonate with that mindset, and within minutes I had regained some hope. Now I can't do ki blasts or withstand 100x earth gravity, but I realized at that moment I held the power to change in my own hands.\\n\\nStepping out of the shower that day I swore to myself I would change in ALL areas of my life. I cut all contact with my ex. I started eating healthy, started to lift, downloaded tinder to improve my texting game, took a decent paying job, started to go out in public alot more often. Half a year later I already made some big changes, I was getting complements from other guys about my muscles, got a job at a café so I could get social experience and money and I started to get some tinder dates. However most of them turned out to be average even though they looked hot in their profile pictures. Didn't get laid either because I was looking for LTR. I just didn't understand what I was doing wrong even after all this change, I was being nice to girls and my mind was still on my ex most of the times...\\n\\nThen came one of my biggest decisions: fixing my pectus excavatum with a surgery. My heart and lungs got more space, plus my appearance improved (no more dent in chest = self esteem doubled, yay). But the pain from the surgery was one of the worst physical pains I've ever felt. Because I basically couldn't leave the house for 2 months I decided to delete tinder and put all my focus on my mind and health. I started reading and doing research online about human psychology, neuroplasticity and my nerd loving self even tried to find links between Dragon Ball Z and the psychology behind it.\\n\\nThen I somehow stumbled onto this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/47gun0/anime_and_trp/\\n\\nI didn't know what TRP was and at first I thought this was just a place for guys bragging about how they fuck girls. But I kept on reading and all the pieces of the puzzle slowly started to fall into place. Slowly started to realize I missed so many red flags during my LTR and starting to see where I had Blue pill traits. Remembering the letter I wrote her in my all time low blue pill state of mind (Thank god I didn't send her that letter), I took it out of my room and torched it. For the first time in almost a year I felt like I was finally starting to drop my past and focus on the future. I started to feel free again.\\n\\nI've been lurking for a few weeks before I decided to sign up and thank you guys. Dragon Ball Z led me to this place and I don't care about anyone commenting with the rule 'Use of fiction or other controlled narratives (reality tv, etc) should only be used as an example of the author's psychology, not the character's.'. It made me find this place, which is much more important to me.\\n\\nThe past year I've been so much more productive than any other year in my life, and i'm so thankful for the fact that I discovered TRP at 21 years old, there is so much more life ahead of me so I get to enjoy the major part of my life that is still to come. I fell in love with improving myself, some things are hard to do but I don't see it as a choir. \\n\\nI gained some RP traits, and discarded some BP ones. I'm for a fact not 100% RP yet, but lurking for a while made me realize it takes a long time (several years) to really learn and implement all this stuff.\\nKnowing there are guys out there that felt like I did made me feel a lot stronger. \\n\\nI'm looking forward to learn and become a full RP one day. \\n\\nThank you TRP ;)\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I meant to write this a few weeks/months back, but forgot. I was thinking about it a little while ago and it's something really made me appreciate how far I've come when I ran into an ex. First off I've been in this community for a long time now, starting with pickup in 2007 and evolving into dabbling with men's rights and MGTOW, but never forgetting my PUA origins. Over the years I've had a variety of successes and failures and learned a ton of lessons with regards to women and life in general.\\n\\n\\nA couple years back I had a long-term relationship that I felt was the best relationship I ever had. The first year was amazing, but looking back it was largely because it was a long-distance relationship with us only seeing each other 1 or 2 days a week, and her being BPD or at least having shades of it.\\nWe ended up splitting up after I lost frame regarding her orbiters being too close for comfort and she moved away after staying with one of them for a few months. Long story short I ran into her and we ended up fucking like rabbits. She was tight and I thought hadn't had sex in awhile, but she let slip that I'm so much bigger/better than the orbiter guy who broke us up as she hooked up with him after we split, but he's apparently now firmly in the friend-zone with her again.\\n\\n\\nIt was a huge ego boost with how bluntly she said it being drunk and in the zone as we fucked. I think it was a case of her letting her inner slut out by accident. Overall it was probably a one-time deal as she was actually staying at the orbiter friend's place when she was in town. Obviously he has no idea I picked her up, fucked her silly, and she gave up everything to include us recording our activities :) I sent her on her way without her having a chance to brush her teeth after she swallowed and part of me is hoping that asshole she was staying with tried to get a piece so he literally had my sloppy seconds. \\n\\nIf ever there was a winner when it comes to grudge fucking, then I got the gold medal. That being said, the only reason things went as well as they did was because I didn't care about how things went and was truly carefree allowing me to make fun of her here and there and was generally being an ass in the roguish sort of way rather than a butthurt scorned lover one. I couldn't have done that without TRP... and I have the video and pics to prove it :)\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Before I continue the two examples of how TRP has directly applied to my life, I\\'d like to preface that in my first story with a few facts.\\n\\nEvery example of NiceGuy/Beta Bux, that was me.\\nEvery example of showing a girl with affection until she loved you, that was me too.\\nEvery example of the closer you try to bring a girl in, the further she goes away, directly applied to my life.\\nThat dipshit who expected \"the one\" and romantic shit like How I Met Your Mother happening? You fucking guessed it, that was me too.\\n\\nNow then, story time. I had been dating a girl for about a year and a half, from my junior year of high school to the summer we graduated. We drifted apart, we mutually broke up, we move on with our lives. After about a year, we get back together since we believed that each other was \"the one\". This lasts for about 2 months, before she breaks up with me. Que the next year of the most beta misery I\\'ve ever been through, taking place from about August last year, to maybe the middle of this April. During this year, she\\'s walked in and out of my life. Fucking me, making empty promises of some future relationship again, and then going out with her friends. Of course, like the common beta, I text her every morning when I wake up, because that\\'s what women want, right? Right. And when she didnt reply all day, I\\'d check each of her social media pages for new posts, and then send her two or three more texts. You know, just in case. \"Who the fuck is this guy you\\'re hanging with?\", \"Why don\\'t you wanna talk?\". You get the idea. Keep in mind, this went on for almost a year. I\\'m sure any beta bux, fucking cuckold story ever told applies to my case by now. After countless times of this poison coming in and out of my life, making me wish I was dead every other day, I decided that this previous time was the last time. Enter TRP. To be honest, I don\\'t even know how the fuck I found this place. I\\'ve never had anyone tell me about it, and I definitely don\\'t remember Googling \"How to take my life back from a toxic cunt\". I found this sub, realized that every beta story applies to me, learned about shittests, game, you fucking name it. I\\'ve only been here for maybe 2 weeks, but I\\'ve learned so much about the fucking world already, and I know there\\'s so much more to learn.\\n\\nNow then, without further delay, here are the two stories of how TRP changed my life. The first being extremely satisfying to me.\\n\\n**Story 1**\\n\\nThe same toxic woman from the prefacing story, after the last time she\\'s walked out, I realized that if she wants to be treated like a plate, then I\\'ll give her exactly that. I stopped responding to her texts, I stopped texting her every day, and I stopped begging her to hang out with me. I stopped asking what she\\'s doing, and when she asks \"does that make you mad?\", I\\'d just shrug and move on with my life. Eventually, the tables turned. She started texting me when she woke up, and if I didn\\'t respond, she\\'d text again, and again. If I was out, she\\'d send me so many that it became funny. Meanwhile, I\\'m just focusing on making my life better for the sake of getting on with my life. Eventually she says \"I\\'m done trying with you\" or something like that, and all I said was \"Kbye\". Within about 3 days, she comes over, we fuck three times in a row. It\\'s literally the exact opposite of the year before, and it feels like a breath of fresh air. I have zero intention of making her a LTR again, but until I next her, her pussy is pretty good.\\n\\n**Story 2**\\n\\nNot nearly as long, but it is an interesting example of how women respond to anything that isn\\'t flattery. I\\'m just fucking around on Facebook, when I see a pretty good looking girl post a mirror selfie. Her body is pretty nice, so I decide \"fuck it\" and message her.\\n\\n\"You\\'re cute as hell, but your phone case...\"\\n\\n\"Thank you and shut up lol\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m just saying you should have a case that isn\\'t ugly either. we\\'ll go buy one tomorrow\"\\n\\n\"Who, you and me?\"\\n\\n\"If you go alone, you\\'ll probably pick out a horrible one again.\"\\n\\n\"Where are we going?\"\\n\\nI couldn\\'t fucking believe it. I didn\\'t even ask her if she WANTED to go or if she had anything else to do, and it got me way fucking further than any other message I\\'ve ever sent to anyone. At this point, I\\'m not really trying to get really trying to get laid, more like experimenting what I\\'ve learned. But holy fucking shit, thank you Red Pill.',\n",

       "  'selftext': '**TL;DR: Live life for you, because it can be taken away from you in an instant.**  \\n  \\nFor my entire 29 years of living, I\\'ve been a blue pill. I proudly considered myself a feminist. I considered women to be equal to men, quite literally *the same* as men in terms of not just rights, but thinking. I looked at men who pick up women as slimy and sleazy. I called them \"bros.\" I wasn\\'t like them - I was different. I was better, I thought. They just wanted sex; I treated with women with respect, I valued them. Blue Pill beta, through and through.  \\n  \\nWhen I vistied the TRP for the first time, I read the top posts. Some of the stories on there shook me to the core. After that, I began reading the sidebar. I came to TRP with full intentions of scoffing, laughing, and leaving. That is not what happened. Instead, I found that I identified with nearly everything that I was reading. Though reluctant to believe it, I continued reading. The more I read, the more I came convinced.  \\n  \\nLast Tuesday, I suddenly and abruptly experienced the worst chest pain I\\'ve ever had in my life. While clutching my chest, my only words were - *what the hell is happening to me?* Imagine a wooden block with nails through it pressing down on the inside of your chest - that was the pain I felt. My left arm went numb. My left leg went numb.   \\n  \\nAn ambulance came and took my vitals and immediately ruled out a heart attack. In the E.R. they did an EKG, and the nurse asked me a ton of questions about diet, exercise, recent travel, family history, etc. There was waiting. Lots of waiting. Hours passed. They eventually took me away for a CAT scan. Another hour of waiting in the E.R., then the doctor came in to see me.  \\n  \\n  \\n\"Any idea what caused the pain?\" I asked.  \\n  \\n\"Yes, we actually found a blood clot in your lung. Also called a pulmonary embolism.\"  \\n  \\nI was stunned.  \\n  \\n\"What would have caused that?\" I asked.  \\n  \\n\"We\\'re not sure yet, but it\\'s a good thing you came in. The consequences can be devastating.\"  \\n  \\nI looked at him. \"And when you say devastating, you mean...\"  \\n  \\n\"Fatal,\" he interrupted.  \\n  \\n  \\nHe was right. A week laid up gives one plenty of time to research. There are around 200-600,000 cases of pulmonary embolisms in the US per year. One third are fatal. Often the cause is easy to pinpoint. I\\'ve been out of the hospital since Tuesday, and there\\'s still no known reason as to why or how the blood clot formed. I\\'m an active runner, 5-15 miles per week. I eat healthy. I am fit. I do not travel. There is no family history of sudden death or blood clots.  \\n  \\nA week laid up, visitors came in went. I passed the time watching CNBC (fin. advisor for a living), browsing reddit during the day.  \\nAt night, I always hopped on TRP. The more I read, the more I became convinced of the lie of feminism, and the value of being a man. **I found a reason to live for myself. TRP was my sanctuary.**  \\n  \\nOver the past ten days, I\\'ve learned more about women TRP than I have my entire life. I\\'m finally seeing reality for what it is, and I never even knew I was asleep! And worst of all, I almost died before I unplugged.   \\n  \\nI don\\'t know where this new road will take me, but I\\'m happy to be on it. I\\'m happy TRP is here and for its contributors that serve as guides to us, the recently unplugged.  \\n  \\nTo my fellow men out there: life is too short to not get what you want. It can end abruptly, without notice, without fairness. Use the time you have. Today. Now. Get out there and claim what\\'s yours. Accomplish what you dream of doing.  ',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Started reading redpill a month ago. Last week, went to a party, with my rp mindset I found myself talking to a bunch of people including one girl I\\'ve known for a while. She tried to make out with me but passed the fuck out cause she was a drunk bitch. I put her down on the bed but was annoyed that she was wasting my time -- went out and socialized with other people and went home. She texts me asking what happened and I just check if she\\'s ok and that\\'s it.\\n\\nA week passes. Text her saying \"let\\'s hang out.\" She agrees but tries to be all organized, asking me where we\\'re going. I deflect and joke around and she eats it up. I take my time replying and show up a little bit late because I was busy picking up condoms anyway.\\n\\nI pick her up, she\\'s being quiet and nervous as fuck. Old me would have been freaked out by her energy, but nowadays it didn\\'t affect me at all. Made some small talk and then started teasing her more since she was being so bad at responding. This pushed her buttons and she started trying to prove herself to me.\\n\\nTook her to get food since she didn\\'t eat dinner but made he pay for her own stuff, had a couple drinks at my place, told her to look me in the eye when I was teasing her and started making out with her. First time in my life (I\\'m graduated from college for age reference) that I initiated kissing a girl. We start making out, go upstairs, I take off her clothes aggressively. She keeps saying \"I\\'m nervous, is this okay\", I reassure her and ask what\\'s wrong. She tells me she\\'s been seeing this \"really nice\" guy. I tell her that doesn\\'t matter, we\\'re just here to have fun. Keep reassuring her. I don\\'t force anything, just make out with her and feel her up while grinding on her until she gives me the greenlight -- \"I want you inside me\". I put on condom and we fuck. Guess what. It was her first time. Chick has dated two dudes, one for over a year and now this new \"nice guy\" and she\\'s never even had sex. She tells me I\\'m a \"bad boy\" and that she had so much fun and is begging me to hit her up again later. I said we\\'ll go with the flow and grope her ass and she\\'s all happy.\\n\\nChecked her FB. \"Nice guy\" is just a normal looking guy. They went to Disneyland last weekend. How cute. I\\'m sure she\\'s \"saving herself\" and telling him she\\'s not ready for sex yet. Meanwhile I told her to go masturbate and figure out how to orgasm so we can have more fun next time.\\n\\nAWALT. Got my needs taken care of. None of the fear or regret that I\\'ve had in the past with being too meek with girls. No anxiety the entire time, from when I picked her up, teased her, dealt with shit tests (before and DURING fucking), and breaking down her walls. Took a girls virginity and don\\'t even feel like it was a big deal. Just happy to help a girl learn what real orgasms feel like. I\\'m the biggest cock she\\'s had after all.\\n\\nAll thanks to TRP. Before this, the only sexual relations I had was a Borderline Personality Disorder girl who pulled me into bed and fucked me. Now I\\'m doing it on my own terms.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'This is my letter of gratitude to TRP.\\n\\nFirst, some background.  I am 50 years old, married (somewhat happily), with 2 teenage sons. I work as a Registered Nurse (a very blue pill/white knight profession in a predominantly female industry).  Without going into details, I\\'ve been horribly beta my whole life, but somehow stumbled onto Victor Pride\\'s Bold and Determined website.  Eventually I landed at the Red Pill.  Here\\'s a summary:\\n\\n**Positive Changes I have made**\\n\\n- finally got out of the Army Reserve.  I remember reading a quote in a TRP thread that said this:  \"Be willing to walk away from anything or anyone who doesn\\'t help you, grow you, or benefit you in some way\".  My Army career was not as fulfilling as I had hoped.  I\\'m glad I served, but I am at peace with leaving.\\n\\n- grew a beard.  A serious beard. Ceremonially trashed AR 670-1 \"Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia\"\\n\\n- began strength training (actually I think I started this before I found TRP).  I started with Mark Rippetoe, and have been following  Jim Wendler\\'s 5/3/1 for over 1 year\\n\\n- stopped masturbating\\n\\n- competed in my first Powerlifting competition\\n\\n- consistent journaling\\n\\n- reading TRP, specifically the sidebar, which I review periodically.\\n\\n- reading the Bible on a consistent basis\\n\\n- reading the Stoics, particularly The Enchiridion of Epictetus\\n\\n- improved my social circle.  This is primarily related to the contacts I\\'ve made through lifting\\n\\n- consistent meditation\\n\\n- had some [custom-made wristbands]( https://www.amazingwristbands.com/) made to remind me of my daily mantra\\n\\n**Results**\\n\\n- I\\'ve decided to be happy, regardless of my wife\\'s bullshit.  I put up with a lot less crap from her.  Amused Mastery and IDGAF have been a blessing\\n\\n- I feel like I have a MUCH better idea of how to guide my sons into manhood\\n\\n- I have reframed my career as an ER nurse.  I honestly look at it as a test, or like I\\'m going into the Matrix to play.  Yes, nursing can be horrible white knight / blue pill.  But it is truly Alpha to be \"the guy\" who has ice water for blood and knows what to do when a patient is crashing.  In addition, I look forward to controlling/restraining psychotic and violent patients.  This is as close as I will ever get to being a bouncer, and it\\'s far more socially acceptable.\\n\\n- My physique has improved markedly.  I actually have lats and hamstrings, and I almost have traps.\\n\\n- My back pain and knee pain has disappeared.  I consider this crucial, given my job as a ER nurse.\\n\\n- The Powerlifting competition was a rush.  I was the weakest guy there, but it didn\\'t matter.  I hit lifetime PRs in the bench and deadlift, and for one brief moment I felt like [Doyle Kenady]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuXsDU6CsLk).  I missed my second and third attempts in the squat, but I gained valuable feedback on what I must do to succeed next time.  And there will be a next time.\\n\\n- I have found a strength training mentor, and he is becoming a good friend.\\n\\n- Overall, I am calmer.  I\\'ve had terrible anger problems my whole life (a common Blue Pill ailment)\\n\\n- I am a better man for my sons.  They are my pride and joy, but not so much that I will sacrifice their character for anything.\\n\\nSo thank you to the moderators and contributors at TRP.  I am very grateful for all that you have taught me.  I hope you can see in this post that you have made a big difference in just one anonymous life, and in the lives of my family.\\n\\nAnd thank you to Mark Rippetoe, Jim Wendler, [Victor Pride]( https://boldanddetermined.com/), [Mike Cernovich]( http://www.dangerandplay.com/), and the guys at [T Nation.]( https://www.t-nation.com/)\\n\\nFinally, I seem to be receiving much more female attention.  As an example, I leave you with an amusing story. Today I was relaxing in the nurses\\' station before my shift started.  One of my coworkers, whom many would find attractive, walks in.  As she is surprised to see me, she blurts out...\\n\\nHer:  \"Oh my gosh Cover301, I had a VERY inappropriate dream about you the other night!\", as she gently touches my knee.\\n\\nMe:  \"Ok, is this anything you want to tell me about?\"\\n\\nHer:  \"No, I\\'m just going to leave now, because I\\'m blushing\", and she rushes off\\n\\nPeace.\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So, I only recently found TRP, about a year ago I read it, kind of skimmed it, agreed with alot of the sidebar, and just kinda blew it off after that. I only read it because everyone said it was horrible and I wanted to see, because tumblr usually shitting on this subreddit all the time. \\n\\nI was always a beta, I wouldn\\'t be extreme like get mad at hoes because they didn\\'t hold the door open, but I was still envious of the opposite gende.\\n\\nMost of my background knowledge comes from my father, whos a bit of a dick, lot of an alpha, and a hell of a drug addict, yet still had alot of wisdom to tell me. Most of it is outdated, but still he filled my head up with hours of george carlin, bill burr, and other greats, and planted a conspiracy theorist like mindset. A skeptic, if you will.\\n\\nAbout 3 years ago, when I was in 8th grade, I tried to talk to girls, which is fair enough considering my entire flip-phone\\'s contact list is a sausage fest. I failed miserably, becoming an orbiter at every single attempt.\\n\\nAs previously mentioned, I skimmed over this subreddit, and I only took into account to not focus on girls. Until about 3 months ago. I decided to be someone different as I entered my sophomore year, someone more spontaneous, decently comfortable in his own skin, and a bit of a dick. I didn\\'t really care about what people thought of me. But I was also a social retard. In the begining of the year I asked this HB7 to homecoming out of the blue and she said yes, (Keep in mind im a solid 8-9, 6\\', bright green eyes, stubble) but she called it off after 3 days. \\n\\nHomecoming in 3 weeks.\\n\\nAsked out a HB6, immediatley said yes, shes saying I love you on the first date, all that shit, I never said I love you back. A week goes by, then she hits me with-\"My mom said I can\\'t date you because your one year older. we can be friends though\" I didn\\'t care to be honest, because shes kinda ugly.\\n\\nFast forward 1 month later and I catch oneitis for this HB7/8, texted her way too much, she\\'s sending essays worth of emotional baggage for me to calm her down. Try to ask her out,\\n\\n \"Can we just be friends\"\\n\\n Me: \"No.\" \\n\\n Her: \"Oh ok...\" \\n\\nI drift out of her orbit and focus on schoolwork, meanwhile this asshole friend of mine whos a grade above does the typical 1 month, pump(Takes virginity) and dump. meanwhile, I got back on TRP and litterally internalized it as a mindset within that month. Play sports, Haircut, SMV up.\\n\\nWhich brings me to now.\\n\\nI talk to everyone that makes eye contact with me, Flirt with every girl, and having a fun time. Working on losing my V-card. Will never be friendzoned again.\\n\\nI always knew there was some big explanation on why everyone is so godamn miserable all the time.\\n\\nThanks TRP.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I ran into ex today. She was the one that lead me here to TRP. I knew i would see her before I even walked into the taco spot I attended. I totally ignored her. She came to me.  She wanted to be seen. She wondered how I was doing, the regular cliche TV bullshit. Made it clear she wanted physical contact (probably doing all of this for her own benefit). \\n\\nWas she with another guy? No. \\nWas she happier? It seemed so.\\nWas I excited to see her? Fuck no. \\n\\nTruth is I didn\\'t really give a shit about her overall. Probably would\\'ve been more cajoling and less grounded pre-TRP. \\n\\n**The reason I\\'m thanking TRP is because you guys helped me grow to a point where I understood what she is instead of what I wanted her to be, as well as any other woman.** Was this painful to realize? Hell yea, but it\\'s OK. \\n\\nOne thing I detest is showing hatred and butthurt tendencies but the realities, observations, teachings, and constant examples of TRP truths aided me in suppressing that AFC/bluepill self-destructive bullshit. The idealistic pedestal we tend to put women on is extremely damaging and needs to be stopped for our own sake. For me, this is mandatory. \\n\\nIf you\\'re wondering about your former \"one\", just don\\'t. She\\'s fine without you. Hurts? So what? She didn\\'t care, and neither will she ever. \"Love\" or your history together isn\\'t a factor. Don\\'t wish she was dead, fat, ugly, etc. You don\\'t need revenge. You don\\'t need her to come back. She won\\'t save you from anything. She doesn\\'t want to and truthfully she can\\'t. \\n\\nYou need you. That\\'s it. \\n\\nStill have a ways to go of course but my mentality is changing to my benefit. Hope it\\'s the same for you guys as well. Thanks again.\\n\\n It all starts in the mind. ',\n",

Each day I set time aside to work toward them, and after about 4-6 months of chaos, I've formed my habits. My life is fucking amazing now and I have no time to fucking waste. Time is precious, and I have a lot of confidence in myself and in what I do. I think I'm doing it right. I think I understand. I have also moved out of the anger phase, I love the gentle, insecure, sentimental way women are... until their clothes come off and I ram their dripping pussies like the dirty sluts they are in bed. But I digress. They're a great distraction, and they're there anytime I need a break. I want to say I get so much higher working on myself, increasing my knowledge, skills, creative output, body and image, than I ever did trying to orbit other people, especially women I was into. \\n\\nThe moment you enter a stoic mindset and stop giving a fuck about what those around you think, and you aim yourself toward something useful and productive, priorities will change. When you succeed and move forward in a field, that will seem more important than any relationship. I have abundance mentality simply because if a woman leaves, I'll still have my career to work toward, my powerful career that gives me so much satisfaction. So let them come and go, and please me and disappoint me as they think they do, and make a big deal with their girlfriends about me when I'm not around, and overthink and over-analyze everything, and bla bla mental energy wasted. \\n\\nYou guys, do your thing. Don't be afraid to fail, but more importantly learn from your mistakes and apply yourselves. Hate something about yourself? Put in the work. Be mature. Embrace reality.

       "  'selftext': 'After living the blue way all throughout school, college and for a few years afterwards, I\\'ve finally broken the chains.\\n\\nI\\'ve been exploited and stepped on by women I kept on the pedestal at almost all stages of life. It was a series of never ending oneitis. I even developed oneitis for a married woman who used me to get her work done. Old beta me found balls and finally did get something out of her, but it was still pathetically meaningless.\\n\\nAfter finding you guys, and internalizing the core tenets of TRP, I started on the path of self-improvement. I learnt how the female psyche works, what turns them on, how to talk to them, etc. I dominated in conversations and even more so in bed. Beta me would have cuddled and said \"I love you\" even on a one night stand, but not me.\\n\\nI wanted to thank you all today because this past week I turned down two women who were crazy about me. And one was LTR material - a unicorn. Why? To focus on my dreams, and to let the unicorn graze in peace. This would not have been possible if not for you veterans. I\\'ve found women to be not worth my precious time.\\n\\nI hope to post back in a few months time after I\\'ve realized my goals. Again, thank you.',\n",

       "  'selftext': '**Intro** \\n======\\n\\n\\nClassic Beta is led on by gf, not getting any, shakes the status quo thanks to this sub, immediate results.\\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n**Body**  \\n=====\\n\\nI am almost one year with this girl who is older than me (22 v 26), and at first, it was nice. She was somewhat frigid in bed, but nothing special.  \\n\\nThen, a few months in, she started making excuses for not coming to my place. I thought those were honest, and didn\\'t push it. Sex became rarer and rarer. Then, one time after sex, she starts talking about this guy who was her only fwb who tricked her into sleeping with him. Then she said how it was the best sex she ever had. How the fact that he wasn\\'t her bf at the time made it awesome.  \\n\\nI played it cool, but inside...I was burning inside. Raging fire was choking my every thought. There is some guy out there who fucked her better than me, she liked him more than me, she said he was such a charmer, she doesn\\'t do sex out of a relationship, but he was irresistible. She said he could get every girl there is, and he chose her. Then she babbled something about her ignoring him after 4th or 5th hookup.  \\n\\nI realized something was off, but I didn\\'t react. I genuinely started loving her maybe 6 months in, even thinking if I will ever be able to get another girl as good as her. Maybe it wasn\\'t love then. Anyway, I was the sweetest boyfriend a girl could have. I bought her flowers regularly, respected her busy schedule working at a café, jumping to meet her for coffee or even only to tag along as she did her errands, just because \"I missed her so much\". I did all college administration stuff for her, because she was so busy with her job etc. She even made me *feel* in charge, even though I was her slave practically.  \\n\\nThen, 10 months in, that \"off\" feeling started overshadowing our relationship, and I said fuck it, I\\'m going to break up. I do, and she cries and pleads, makes me go to her place at 3am just to talk, no sex again. I go to sleep and wake up at 5am, and I start to cry. I cry and cry, and that wakes her up. She sees me, and hugs me out of pity. I go home. We are together again.  \\n\\nThings don\\'t change at all, they are even worse actually. Last month whole passed without sex.  \\nFastforward 5 days ago: she asks me to go talk to her professor about an exam day after, she can\\'t because she\\'s working during his office hours. I go, and prof says that because she\\'s the only student remaining who didn\\'t pass his subject, someone will need to go with her to be a witness. I say to her I would gladly come. She sends me a thank you and a :*. I ask her if she\\'s working after the exam, she says she has a day off, but she wants to go to country with her parents.  \\n\\nI flipped out when I read the message, and in the moment of anger I say to her I won\\'t be able to make it to her exam, she will need to find another witness. She flips out on me back, and says it\\'s end for our relationship. I say okay. That night, a random mention of /r/redpill in a reddit post pulled me inside. I so fucking found myself here, sidebar gets chewed up in that one sleepless night, and I am certain I can apply my newfound knowledge today.\\n\\nWhat\\'s funny, is that I already have 3 alternatives in case I break up with her, I started flirting with several girls after our first break up. I just still was insecure about myself, and that feeling that she\\'s the best I can do was there still.  \\n\\nRedpill erased all that, and I started to wonder how far can I push her. Turns out, really fucking far.  \\n\\nNext day she texts me that I should be ashamed of myself for what I did to her, day before the big exam! I say, exact words:  \\n\\n\"You haven\\'t been giving to me what I wanted. I did everything for you until yesterday, when I realised it will always be like this. Now I don\\'t give a fuck\"  \\n\\nFurious messages keep arriving, and after about 10, I just say: \"Tomorrow 18h, my place.\"  \\n\\nSilence for about 3-4 minutes, and then she sends: \"But I work until 17:30!\". 1 minute after that, \"Okay\". I say okay too and stop answering messages until she came. Of course she came. I stop all her talking, put on Massive Attack - Mezzanine (I know she hates it, but I love it for sex), and start undressing her. She fights back, I put my hand in her pants. We fuck. We finish, she\\'s still mad, I tell her it\\'s gonna be this way, or no way. Door gets shown, she leaves.  \\n\\n2 hours later, she\\'s texting me if I love her anymore. I ignore it. She says we need to talk this through. I say I don\\'t want to be with a girl that was at my place 2 hours ago. She says she will change. She wants to meet up. I say I can\\'t I am going to a student congress at 13h. She says I will be fucking other girls there. She really needs me tomorrow. I pull off the same trick: \"tomorrow 10h my place\". She complies. That\\'s 10 hours from now, and I can\\'t wait to see her behaviour when she comes again (pun intended).  \\n\\n-----------------------------\\nConclusion\\n===========  \\n\\n\\nSo there you go guys. My behaviour may have been influenced even before by me starting lifting real weight 2 months ago, and being a first witness to great friend\\'s demise because he was too beta for a hottie who dumped him after a year of \"perfect relationship\". Also, I started getting embarrassed when I told people \"we are together for almost a year now\". It was a fucking long year, I hope you all learn something from my mistakes.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hello TRP\\n\\nI've never submitted something like this before (so please be kind).\\nAll I wanted to say was thank you. Sincerely. Having split up from my girlfriend of 4 years in February I've been feeling pretty miserable since then. I'm a total Beta, I paid for everything, spent all my hard earned money on travelling and her car, all sorts. I was that whipped I practically wrote all her coursework and dissertation for University. I've been such a fool. \\nSince finding TRP about 4 days ago I have begun to realize that my own life and dreams should have been my top priority. I didn't even vet her, otherwise alarm bells would have been ringing over her cocaine habit, insecurity, daddy issues and the trauma she received (domestic violence) from her last boyfriend. As she took my virginity I was pretty keen to kneel over and do as I was told. More fool me.\\n\\nThe point is, since I found TRP I have begun to look at life in a much more selfish way. I started lifting two months ago out of pure spite, in the vain hope that if she were ever to see me again she'd be super jealous. Now I meditate everyday, read a lot (which I wasn't allowed to do because I wasn't spending time with her) and lift weights to benefit me. As well as this I've been accepted on to a Master's degree program and have started pursuing cycling and astronomy for the sheer fun of it. \\n\\nOnce again, thank you TRP. You've pulled me from the depths of despair and self loathing in an incredibly short time. The collective wisdom of TRP is base realism, the advice is genuine and motivating. Thank you so much. \\n\\n(Really sorry if I broke any rules or posted this wrong somehow)\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So just last week i listened to the audio book for no more Mr. nice guy which i feel may have been thee most  important book i\\'ve ever read in my life . It made me appreciate not being the blue pill i thought i needed to be to be liked , loved, and considered of value and instead it taught me to approach life with a more alpha mentality, if i make myself happy then and only then can i make others happy and attract those who want to be a part of my happiness. The biggest gaping hole in me as a person  has been dealing with abandonment issues and feeling unloved due to what i viewed as a weak absentee father that never cared for me. \\n\\nThankfully the book helped me to see that I saw my father for the image my mother painted of him , not for who he actually was and it reccomended i try to get a new father figure or reach out to my father  to gain insight and wisdom on his perspective of being a man. I did so immediately after finishing that chapter. \\n\\nSo the night began like any other with my dad, we loosely talked about or jobs in vague terms , trying to sound interested and invested in eachother but like all of my brief meetings with him until this point. It ultimately felt like two strangers dancing around their true feelings .\\n\\nAfter we ordered food, sat down, and chatted a little more i opened up to him . I told him about reading the book and how it had opened my eyes . How my mother made him out to be a monster, how i hated him, how i felt abandoned by him , and yet how i always wanted to know him better and my goal was to understand him better by the end of the night.\\n\\nHe shared with me that he hated himself for the mistakes he made with my mom. How he had tried to make various connections with me but my moms anger wouldn\\'t let him at first and then just dealing with his personal guilt made him shitty when he was near me when i was younger.\\n\\nWe talked about a lot i had questions about my grandfather , i found out two potential siblings were aborted before my dad accepted my pregnancy with my mother. I heard from his mouth why they broke up . He told me about his childhood .  It was a really open and honest conversation that i needed and I  think it provided nourishment for both of us both emotionally and mentally.\\n\\nI think what i loved more than anything was hearing the old man spout red pill truths he attained over his life  \" Don\\'t get pussy whipped and know your value\",  \" being in a relationship with a woman is like managing a child\", and  he even showed me a few facebook exchanges he has with women half his age , none he\\'s interested in leaving his LTR for but always knowing he has options. He me tioned he shared the fact they reached out to him with her....perhaps his own personal dread game?\\n\\nIt was fantastic and i especially enjoyed when he said he saw the changes that took place in me . For the first time in my life i told him I loved him  and actually meant it, didn\\'t say it because i was supposed to, didn\\'t say it because i had to, i said it because i felt it and i wanted to let him know.\\n\\nI also feel proud of myself for arranging a meeting with him, for setting the tone of our conversation and being the first to speak up, as i said that book may be THEE most important thing i\\'ve ever read  and it\\'s all thanks to TRP . \\n\\nThank you Gentleman  getting women is well and good but you have all helped me grow more in the last few weeks than i had over the past 25 years. My selef esteem is higher than it\\'s ever been and i realize now just how many insane insecurities i was holding onto before..... Who thinks to himself regularly and completely  unnaproached \" am I breathing too loud\"? Somebody who feels his very existence needs to be validated and  managed to others expectations with each passing breath. \\n\\nThank you all.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Ihave been lurking this sub-Reddit for a long time, i stumbled across it somehow but remember how apalled i was initially reading it . How chauvanistic , abusive, and misguided i felt the \"knowledge\" spouted here was. In my blue pill philosophy this sub-reddit was just a bunch of losers who didn\\'t understand and appreciate women the way i did. A bunch of sour pusses angry at women for no real reason. Meanwhile i sat in a temple of vaginas as their non-aggressive loveable teddy bear...that they could never consider fucking and honestly was there more often for their to be their shoulder to cry on and offer emotional and inspirational support as they bemoaned their desire for aggressive asshole exes that used them up and spit them out. \\n\\nStill despite that first impression i found myself stealing brief moments increasingly to get a glance at this sub-reddit . I Read anecdotes, quotes, acronyms, mantras and began to see some parallels of the themes presented here that mimicked my own personal relationships.  Which truly began to confuse me, all my life women had told me i needed to be a prince to get my princess , perfect, handsome, and women would rever and respect me and yet when doing that i hardly if ever garnered real interest from the opposite sex. Little by little i began to see parallels in The red pill philosophy and how women responded to me when i unintentionally did things that aligned with it.... Maybe...maybe this sub-reddit was onto something?\\n\\nI mean how is it that recent calls with my ex girlfriend of 6 years  and highschool sweetheart are filled with more respect and love after not having seen her in nearly a year  (and that was a short dinner ) than most of our day to day conversations when i was hopelessly in love with her and treated her like a princess? Also during this princess phase she cheated on me twice ..and yet now every text or phone call i get she tells me how she loves me or misses me in my absence.\\n\\nWell in the last few weeks the tenants, anecdotes, accronyms, and logic spouted on this board has resonated withing me louder than ever. I find myself increasingly wanting to be a man of value and that is now my focus . Still it has felt like for the longest time something was missing , i feel like an Old boy...not a young man.  So i have been looking for TRP media , listening to Patrice oneals radio show archives , watching youtube clips,  and finally i looked on the reading list and see that No More mr. Niceguy which is referenced here endlessly has a free audio book available. \\n\\nI decided to start listening to the 6.5 hour audiobook yesterday and will finish the final hour today. \\n\\nThis book has been SUCH a revelation into , into what it means for ME to be a man , it does such a good job of showing you the direction aman walks but as a man only you know what kind of man you are or wish to be. They author pushes you off the dock and asks you to row yourself out i to the sea of masculinity . \\n\\nIt has been eye opening because technically  in age I am a man(26) , in terms of responsibility sure I am a man (have my own apartment, have a car, have a solid career) , but that feeling of being a man has just never been there and the book essentially showed me that it\\'s because I have been a filtered man.... I am a PC man, a man without the ugly bits, I am a man with a muzzle...that was true until yesterday. I have only begun rowing my boat but i owe it to myself to row as hard and fast as i can to get lost in the wide and deep expanse of masculinity. \\n\\nIt\\'s fascinating how i now see that my needs, my desires, my deeds and accomplishments, i have lived for every creature around me except for myself and how i told myself i was happy yet clearly i expressed resentful and clearly unhealthy behaviors.\\n\\n I tried so hard to be  a man without fangs that i didn\\'t realize that sometimes you need fangs , sometimes being passive isn\\'t the right answer, sometimes it\\'s ok to do EXACTLY what you\\'d like to do, not just what you say you\\'d like to do because of percieved limitations.\\n\\nAnyway i can go on and on about this book it even has me considering trying to reconnect with my absentee father, for me this is massive considering my father has been an emotional boogeyman for the entirety of my life, a dark monster i pretend doesn\\'t matter to me and yet i never appreciated in my hatred or disdain that refusing to understand and even  attempt consider him as a human being  that i was denying a part of a root part of my conception, a key contributer to my literal DNA. It\\'s trying to create the best version of me without understanding the successes , pitfalls, and perspectives of a prior iteration a blue print of a man so to speak.\\n\\nThis book has been eye opening and it gives me hope, inspiration,and fills me with excitement towards the prospect that i can and do have the power to become a man that can respect himself. I\\'m not there yet but i\\'m on my way, i feel like the road for me to follow has been paved and i plan to continue down it. I offer my eternal thanks to Dr. Robert Glover and a million thanks to TRP and all its contributors.  If you\\'re the least bit curious about this book i reccomend you read and / or listen to it. It\\'s magnificent . I plan on going back through it and exploring the excercises within it further.\\n\\nEdit: i think after praising it it\\'s only right to include a link to it  as well for anyone else traveling the path  and fix a few typos. http://yourlisten.com/aceofplace/no-more-mr-nice-guy',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'TL;DR: I got oneitis, changed my whole personality from Alpha to complete Beta, let my girlfriend lie about communication with other men, knowingly ignored red flags, started reading TRP, shot hamster, shined light on her lies and bounced the psycho. Feeling really great about it. Thanks Red Pill.\\n\\nJust to be clear, this is a throwaway. My ex girlfriend is so invasive of my privacy, she ‘randomly’ found my reddit account... Twice. She likes to lurk and I would rather her not know anything about TRP and what it has taught me. My name is going to be slandered, but not because I care, she just doesn’t deserve any ammunition against me.\\n\\nI\\'m 25. The Red Pill gave me my identity back and helped me take back my sanity. It cost me a possibly lethally abusive relationship with a psychotic woman and I couldn\\'t be more happy about it. \\n\\nBefore November 2014, I was a fucking Alpha and embraced TRP ideologies before investing in it. Great upbringing, fit, competitive, athletic, college educated, awesome job in my field, slayed a fair amount of quality pussy, confident in my abilities as a man to my core, the whole nine yards... \\n\\nI met a lady who I thought was an absolute gem, got a pathetic case of oneitis, ignored every single red flag and trashed my own personal code of ethics regarding the opposite sex. This girl I met crushed my character and personality, then molded me into a coward. I don\\'t blame her because I let it happen, knowing that I was compromising my sense of self-respect and self-worth. I was everything the blue pill is, a white knight, self-hating pussy that tried to live up to impossible expectations. \\n\\nThis girl had baggage like no other that I never should have allowed her to bring to my life: Daddy issues, a mentally abusive past caused by an unpredictable psycho ex, an ungrateful attitude toward her current life and career, major signs of Borderline Personality Disorder/Narcissistic Personality Disorder and self-hatred for herself that she projected on me every step of the way. A fucking pathological liar. I was an enabler, she shredded me for over a year and a half. \\n\\nHer favorite weapon was manipulation and she was a master. She built me up, then slammed me over and over. She craved control and made me pay dearly for every mistake I made, never letting me forget what I’d done wrong all the way till the end. She would violate my privacy going through my phone, she’d be jealous of any woman I had interactions with, and made sure I felt that I was lucky to be with her because of how worthless I was. Again, I don’t blame her, I let this happen to myself with my BETA behavior with the hope to bring happiness to this unhealthy relationship. I own this shit fully.\\n\\nI see the truth now: My ex is a pathological, psychopathic liar. However, I allowed myself to be blind to the truth. Starting out, she left loose ends with her abusive ex boyfriend and I tried to be the man to save her because she couldn’t heal from her pain. She opened up to me about this guy and how terrible he was, always blaming him for the reason why the relationship failed. This girl claimed that she never talked to the guy and I believed her, even when I would catch him texting her. She\\'d just lie so many times to keep me in the dark even when I had clear evidence, I wanted to believe she was a unicorn, that she was an ethical human. Every time I raised an eye brow, she would have a melt down and manipulate me to think I was in the wrong for thinking that she was really contributing to the communication. I failed every single solitary shit test she threw my way, never once asking for proof (accessing her phone and social media accounts)out of fear of being controlling. She took full advantage and I poured the gasoline over my head.\\n\\nAfter 8 months of believing that I was dating an incredible woman, she started to take the mask off. The verbal assaults were constant, the manipulation was off the charts, and she made me question who I was even after 24 years of being a confident and secure man. In September, the shit hit the fan and she came clean out of the blue about her communication with her ex because she felt she should tell me. I tried to hold frame, but dammit was I in shock that I’d ignored my gut and even my friends saying she was lying to me. She hamstered and hamstered why she lied to my face and let me feel horrible for questioning her rational. I went into a depression. I forgave her, but didn\\'t forget about it until the end. Pathetic, take note here.\\n\\nI questioned everything she ever said and did prior to her confession. Whenever I brought these insecurities to her attention, she threw a tantrum so bad to the point where I didn\\'t believe I had a case for concern and I blame myself today. The bitch demanded my trust right after telling me the truth and I foolishly believed her bullshit again. However, I still wondered what was true and what she’d done right in front of my face. She had to have fucked at least one guy I know of, I let her go hangout with this friend at the bar on night in July 2015. Said she’d be there for an hour tops. Three hours went by without much communication, and then she called to tell me she was going back to his house to smoke some pot. Reluctantly, I said it was okay on grounds that he was her close friend from grade school, was not going to drink over there and would only be there for a few minutes. She was there till 3 in the morning and called me to tell me she was on here way home. The following day, I confronted her, called her out because she put a snapchat picture on her story of her drinking a beer and she denied drinking there at all. I don\\'t need solid evidence to know what occurred, I let this shit happen to me and I don\\'t blame her.\\n\\nFrom TRP, I discovered ‘trickle truth’... The definition embodies this woman and the relationship I had with her. \\n\\nThat same month, I found some messages from another ex lover, read them and confronted her. She manipulated me like she always did, denied ever doing anything wrong, stated she hadn\\'t talked to the guy since before we started dating, and I let it go like all the other shit because of her verbal abuse. I never once asked to see her phone fearing that I was being too controlling and needy. Bitch move on my part.\\n\\nThe issue was approached multiple times over the next 4 months and I still let her wiggle out of it and thought myself an idiot for asking. Last night, I presented it again because I remembered a specific event that was discussed in the messages, a sporting event the guy invited her to attend with him. At this point, I\\'d been reading TRP for a month or so and started to throw them back by the bottle, I began improving my frame. After crossing the boundaries of communication with other men, I\\'d started to throw fits like she did and let her get the absolute best of me. Before TRP, I was acting like a toddler and never had prior to this evil broad, but after my awakening, I started changing my strategy. Frame was critical in gaining an advantage and mine was immovable.\\n\\nAs I held frame, presented my evidence, she crumbled and threw a nuclear temper tantrum resulted in a confession. She claimed that the past was the past and we were so good now that the recent times should eclipse the mammoth lies she’d spun, she didn\\'t know what kind of relationship she really had.. The hamster was sprinting. My ex flipped it all on me, used every manipulation technique she had, brought up my past \\'mistakes\\' in the relationship, told me how much time she wasted on me, blamed me for her actions, denied any reconciliation and didn\\'t own anything. This was the second time she\\'d lied(that I know of) about other men and communication with them. It came down to me asking her again, point blank, did she lie about her communication with this recent boundary line breach and if so, why she thought she was justified by doing so. She floundered, tears flowing, threw my shit around my living room and refused to answer the question directly. I broke up with her, demanded my keys back and held my ground while she packed her shit up. \\n\\nFour months before our relationship ended, my friends and family saw what was happening, they tried to intervene and help me see the light, but I just didn\\'t want to believe. Before breaking up with her, we were fighting almost everyday. I kept failing shit tests and gave her all the power. She owned me through her mind games and manipulation, I felt like a prisoner and a fucking weak man. Fact of the matter is, I was a weak man. It makes me sick looking back on what a person did to change who I was, I loved myself and knew my value before her. \\n\\nShe saw that my frame was unshaken and she panicked. I was gone and she went from apologizing for failing me(yeah, right) to blaming me to justifying her rational and then back to the \\'I love you\\'s. In the parking lot as I helped load her car with the last of her shit, she started begging. For the final time, I told her that I was breaking up with her for her dishonesty and there was nothing she could do or say to win my trust again and turned toward my apartment, she said:\\n\\n\"No, ______! I\\'m breaking up with YOU!\"\\n\\nI stopped to turn toward her. A switch was flipped. All I read from TRP was confirmed at this point. I laughed hysterically, told her she could twist it however she wanted, turned around and headed back up to my apartment. It was as if my life was returned, I wasn\\'t a crazy person like she made me out to be, any feelings I had left for her were killed, and I felt good for the first time since early 2015. I held the power and she knew it. I walked away feeling like I did before choosing to be a Blue Pill mother fucker. I looked in the mirror and my mind was blown, I was right about everything I ever thought from the start.\\n\\nEverything about TRP holds truth, AWALT is the motto and women will take everything from you if you let them. Lessons learned, no tears were shed, and I feel like this decision was the best one available. \\n\\nI was a bitch. I don\\'t blame her for all the mental abuse, I had the power to walk whenever. I will take this mistake, turn it into a positive and regain my sense of self. The TRP ideals are not bullshit, they are concrete. Never allow some bitch control you or change who you are. Be a god damn man, the kind you want to be and know yourself to be.\\n\\nLessons learned:\\n\\n* AWALT\\n\\n* Listen to your gut, your bullshit sensors are real.\\n\\n* Don\\'t put the pussy on the pedestal.\\n\\n* Control your emotions and HOLD FRAME.\\n\\n* Shoot the hamster on the spot when rationalizations for bad behavior attempt to shake your frame and mindset.\\n\\n* Dread her, don\\'t let her dread you. \\n\\n* Put your fucking foot down, set boundaries.\\n\\n* Never settle for anything unacceptable.  \\n\\n* Begin LTR with the mindset to crush bad behavior before habits arise. \\n\\n* Understand the manipulative tactics women use against men to hold the power. \\n\\n* There is no unicorns, always be willing to walk away and demonstrate that you’re number one.\\n\\nI’m not looking for any sympathy or sorrow, I’m not a victim, only the product of my own doings. One of the biggest things I’ve taken away from TRP is to Own Your Shit, respect will follow. I allowed myself to be turned from a talented, career driven Alpha with life goals to a big, fat, BETA BITCH in order to please a hateful and insecure woman with more issues than Playboy magazine. Unicorns aren’t real, frame is critical and vetting a decent LTR is hard as fuck. One day, you just gotta ask yourself... “What are you going to do about it?”\\n\\nYesterday was that day for me and I know I made the right choice. Learn from my story, be your own man, and be happy. Thank you Red Pill, I feel at peace with myself and have my life back.\\n\\nAWALT. Better believe it. ',\n",

I never gamed for relationships. Women came to me or I was *just being myself*. I was purposefully incel for religious reasons and later in life (early 20s) for the sake of \"love\". I never cheated on my women either.  I\\'d fuck only in relationships or with a girl I was really interested in (with a high potential of having a relationship).\\n\\nSo now I know love doesn\\'t exist. Only lust and relationships on any terms. It is freeing. I\\'m in a place where I know pussy is a dime a dozen, that myself and my money should come first. No more wondering **if** this girl was the one bullshit. If she wants me and I\\'m **busy**, she will come to me like they have in the past. \\n\\nMy career is first, any means to make money, and I just negotiated a high paying contract ($30-$40/hr) the most I\\'ve ever made in my life. I have plans to purchase 2 LLCs and begin a small business on the side. \\n\\nMy attitude is ridiculously positive. There\\'s no reason not to be. \"Love\" was my end-game. Now I know through TRP there is no end-game. You keep playing and then one day, you die. I figure make as much money as I can and try to sleep with as many women as I can. It\\'s funny how I used to prioritize women. Now I see them as the miserable time-hoes and money-hoes they really are. I was foolish and young. \\n\\nI\\'ll re-iterate my Thank You. There is no end-game. There is no love shared between a man and a woman. I figure I\\'ll sleep with and then show goodness to these hoes. Especially since I have the option to commit myself and I know to never do that again. My career options have sky-rocketed. I\\'m living an honest life (more IDGAF attitude. Say what I want. Assert myself more). And keeping a healthy and positive relationship with the women I am running my beginner game on. \\n\\nI see all my past mistakes so clearly. The future is bright after the blue pill poison leaves your veins. Thanks again, TRP.',\n",

It turned me from a lifeless fuck who only made fun of people, played video games, and just an orbiter to every girl I met to a person who can be happy by himself without the need of others. For once in my life I can sit down draw, learn Japanese, or workout and be happy. I no longer define my self with social media I define myself and have my own opinions. No one can walk over me any more good deeds get rewarded and bad ones get punished.I'm million times more confident I participate in conversations and take lead of groups. I took down the girl I put on a pedestal for years ignored her and she came crawling back to me. My friends respect me and also learn from me now.

       "  'selftext': \"What has the red pill done for me?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe better question would be, what hasn't it? \\n\\n\\n\\nAfter over a year of using multiple user accounts giving advice to pay back TRP for what I've learned from them, I am checking out. I may come back once and a while to check on the communities growth and also look at the top posts, but I think I'm going to take 6 months off from here at least... Maybe a year. I learn extremely fast (gifted I suppose) and spent the last year internalizing and learning everything possible from TRP. I spent upwards of 1000 hours this past year learning everything I could. Posting, discussing, and immersing myself in the genius of TRP. \\n\\n\\nThis past year has been the best year of my life; but also the hardest. I finally looked at myself in the mirror and learned who I am. It took the better half of 30 years and without TRP I don't think I ever would of. What I've learned from TRP is just unbelievable. I don't know where my life would have ended up had I not stumbled across this subreddit after a terrible breakup. I can't thank everyone enough. It's the most amazing community I've ever been apart of; better than the military, better than a frat (I was apart of both in my life.).\\n\\n\\nI am honored to have been apart of trp. I am honored to have passed on the information I have to others and hopefully helped some like others helped me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Part of my story and why I am so grateful**\\n\\n\\n I can already see why many will hate me in a way for making this post. Look at this good looking smart asshole who already got girls, why does he need TRP? \\n\\n\\nI needed it, trust me. I know, we all need it... But don't hate me for being genetically gifted. My problems were much worse. For one, I fucking hated myself. I was living a lie. I was pathetic towards girls. I acted like such a bitch. I was needy. I was frustrated and couldn't live without a girl in my life.\\n\\n\\nI also didn't know who I was and didn't understand why I was doing what I was in my life. Actually, my job and schooling was all there just to impress women. I was the most fake piece of shit in the world. Living for everyone else, but me. \\n\\n\\nSo for me TRP isn't and never will be a sexual strategy. It was a way for me to introduce myself to myself for the first time. For me to fall in love with myself and stop living though others. To stop trying to please others. And to start living for me.\\n\\n\\n\\nI walk away today because I need to cut this cord also and start a new path. I want to let go of the old me and start fresh with my new found knowledge. I will not forget the old me, rather, I will remember it and cherish it. Because I learned the hard way on how to become the best me possible.\\n\\n\\nI love myself, and I am for the first time happy in my life. I don't need women. I don't need friends, I just need me. This past year and a half has been so hard. Dealing with grief and going through the stages, peering into my own soul, but I must say... I couldn't be happier at this point. I don't need anything more. \\n\\n\\nThis is what TRP is about... Becoming the you that you want to and enjoying it. I realized that recently, and can't be more grateful to this community. You guys really changed my life and helped me in so many ways. I can't even imagine how much I would have wanted to die in the future had I not found this place. Thank you TRP. Goodluck to those that are new, stick around... You'll be grateful you did.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'tl;dr TRP has given me the ability to walk away and I couldn\\'t be happier. A life of Blue Pill was difficult to throw up, but once I applied RP theory, the changes were dramatic. Now that I walked away for the last time, I feel free! \\n\\nThe story: \\n\\nLast August, I lost my job, my dad, and my mom\\'s cancer diagnosis came back positive. The GF at the time couldn\\'t take it and bailed on me for someone else. That was a tough month. I don\\'t remember September. \\n\\nBeginning of October, i start to get to know a gal from Belarus. The Belarus girl is cute, slender, no body fat, great body, and seemingly into me. Although I tried to fight it, the oneitis hit me good. She made me wait for sex and I was ok because hey! What the fuck did I know. She wanted me to open her door all the time and i was happy to make her happy. I adopted her cooking style, eating habits, traveled together, and took care of her place and tried to be a good guy to her kid. Obviously, I think it\\'s easy to see the juxtaposition between the ending of my life as I knew it and the new one that was starting. \\n\\nAfter a few months, things weren\\'t right. My gut was telling me something wasn\\'t right. Her words and her actions didn\\'t seem in sync. There were so many red flags but I didn\\'t care. (e.g. Spending habits, single mom with no parenting skills, kid out of control, stories that always changed, limited empathy for me, and cognitive dissonance galore ).\\n\\nEnter TRP. I browsed but never took it seriously. Then I read No More Mr Nice Guy. My god did that hit home. Being unemployed, I read more and more and more (side bar material and book recommendations). My eyes opened. I was ANGRY. I lost weight, got in shape.... Then came the time to apply TRP.\\n\\nOne night, about 6 months in, the GF said, \"all you want is sex\". This coming from the girl that would only get wet if I literally picked her up and carried her to the bedroom and more than a few references from her past that says she had few boundries when she was younger... So I got up (it\\'s 11pm) and start to leave. She flips her shit and begs me to stay. So I did. No sex that night but the morning sex was great. Practically once a month I had to leave and slowly over time sex became more and more frequent until it was frequent enough for my tastes. \\n\\nHowever, the problems still existed. Sex only made the suffering palatable. We argued monthly and always about sexually related items. I wanted to know about her past, she refused to tell me. She threw herself on the floor once because she refused to talk. I was accused of being a controlling, abusive boyfriend because my questions amounted to insecurity and control issues. I would walk out mid-argument only for her to call me and we\\'d make up. \\n\\nLiving in the moment was the only place we were happy. I refused to make any commitment  beyond my exclusivity unless I understood her past. No past? No future. \\n\\nI\\'ll spare some of the other details, but I finally got a great job a couple months ago. Her first question was what brand car was I going to get. Her next question was when did I want to have a baby. My response was along the lines of \"are you fucking kidding me?\"\\n\\nShe took her son on vacation a couple weeks ago. Her son spent zero time with her. She spent the majority of time on the beach wearing a tiny bikini. Smaller than she ever wore around me. Her ass cheeks were burnt and she admitted than men were hitting on her on the beach. She doesn\\'t drink much, but she had two beers at the hotel bar, hung out with the locals that were more than happy to walk her home, and deny anything happened but won\\'t provide details because that\\'s controlling, abusive behaviour. \\n\\nAt first, my blue pill gut told me it\\'s all my fault. Then Red Pill me said, \"Fuck that.\" \\n\\nMaybe she\\'s right.\\nMaybe nothing happened. \\nMaybe she is a unicorn.\\nMaybe I am an insecure, controlling, abusive boyfriend. \\nMaybe I\\'m right.\\nMaybe RP is right.\\nMaybe nothing happened but the problem is something deeper and hidden.\\n\\nYou know what? Fuck it. \\nI\\'m worth more than some chick\\'s manipulative ways to keep me around while she\\'s free to do whatever. Fuck her. Fuck that. I have my own life to live doing whatever the fuck I want and it doesn\\'t involve her. \\n\\nWe had an argument Sunday. I walked out. We spoke since then. Same story. I walked away. \\n\\nIf not for TRP, I don\\'t know where I would be today. When I lost everything, I found TRP and found myself. I\\'m strong enough to be free and engage relationships on my terms. No empathy? No regards for my emotions? No ability to openly share? Compare me to your past and then unwilling to share details? Walk away.\\n\\nI still have the anger phase at times but it\\'s getting better. \\n\\nSince starting the job, my working out has taken a hit.\\n\\nI need to raise my SMV. I need to lift, eat, sleep, lift, and work. \\n\\nI need guy friends. So sick of chick logic. \\n\\nThanks TRP. Instead of being a doormat, I\\'ve learned to walk out the door. It\\'s empowering. I am learning not to be a slave to my emotions and not cave to someone else\\'s manipulation. It\\'s a long journey, but well worth it.  \\n  \\nEdit: a couple clarifications...\\nA couple beers shouldn\\'t be a big deal. A couple beers for someone that is practically drunk after 1/2 beer at home, rarely drinks, and suddenly has amnesia about their night out, is cause for concern.... when genuinely asking questions about their trip was immediately met with anger and defiance, it raised a red flag.... when they suddenly can\\'t remember details and have gaps in their story, it was a red flag. When they\\'re not excited to see you when they get back from a trip, it\\'s a red flag. When you find out their trip was spent mostly alone because her son refused to spend any time with her, it\\'s a red flag. When something doesn\\'t add up, and your gut screams at you that something is wrong, walk away. The alternative is to stay until you really find out the the truth and then it could be too late. If you really want a LTR, find someone that is willing to be open and share and build a bond with you. Running or hiding from the past will catch up with you one day. Better to live in truth and reality rather than in wishful thinking. \\n\\n\\n',\n",

A little backstory: Most of my life has been depressive with bursts of mania here and there(Biolar disorder) which last year had landed me in some legal trouble, and being placed in a hospital meant to deal with violent individuals. Not getting into that, but towards the end of my stay I was literally 15 seconds away from being murdered, was left with PTSD and subsequently lost most of my social connections. \\n\\n    Now, within the past two or three weeks I\\'ve been lurking and reading TRP at any time I\\'m home and on the internet. Almost immediately after recognizing and applying what I\\'ve read I started to feel alive again. Up until then I got laid maybe once every few weeks, and had to work for it. Fast forward and it\\'s every single day, plus 30 times more amazing than it used to be. I\\'ve been able to leave my house without being constantly paranoid and afraid, I\\'ve been assertive and not taking shit for sake of convenience or avoiding conflict. Most of all, I\\'m enjoying life even in the \"duller\" moments where I\\'m by myself, which used to be a real issue. My depressive episodes have been lasting no more than an hour or two where it used to be days, weeks and sometimes months. Thank you TRP, you\\'ve literally saved my life, plus made it better than it\\'s ever been',\n",

Probably because I would whine about it and wasn\\'t good at communicating my needs.\\n\\nIn one particular struggle, without getting too detailed, I\\'ve been asking for a better server that will help better and faster access to information. Every 3 months or so, there will be a huge surge in needed information, and the senior leadership can\\'t access it in a timely manner. Each time this happens they come after me with pitchforks and torches demanding answers. In the past, I would feel angry and insulted because I took that shit personal. Being so angry wouldn\\'t allow me to effectively communicate as to why they don\\'t have the information they\\'re looking for. I would even sink to blaming other\\'s that fund us just to get them off my back. It was always a sad pathetic mess. Eventually they would grumble and forget about it but the problem would still not be solved. I would just wait until it came back again, trying in vain to get the funding I needed, but I did it in a way that was ineffective.\\n\\nToday, the issue was raised again. I had an E-9, E-8, and a E-7 march into my office demanding what\\'s wrong and why can\\'t they get the information they needed.\\n\\nSince swallowing the Red Pill, I\\'ve been practicing frame in all areas of life, especially work and women. I calmly told them that the reason they don\\'t have the information is due to the technical limitations of our network, and this is how we can fix them with the right funding and a different change in command policy when accessing this information. Whenever the E-9 tried to again pin it on me, I again calmly redirected the issue to what is actually going on and not getting personal about it. This lasted about 10 minutes, and each time I explained in clear non-jargon way what I need to fix the problem, and how he can help me get it.\\n\\nSlowly the senior leader came to my side, and walked out the door but not before saying he was going to talk to the Executive Officer about getting the funding I need and to sit down and have me hash out a change in policy when it comes to accessing our networks, that would be supported from the top-down. An hour later a co-worker commented on how I was always \"cool, calm, and collected\" and it\\'s something she admires.\\n\\nThis wouldn\\'t have happened without the Red Pill and all I\\'ve been practicing since taking that plunge.

       "  'selftext': \"TL:DR Seriously thank you for all your hard work. This sub helped me turn one of the darkest periods of my life around. 7 months ago I was a happy, docile, slightly over weight former alpha man in a committed 5 year relationship. Events unfolded that rocked my world view and if it wasn't for the kinship and advice that I found here I wouldn't have been able to come through what I did in such constructive and determined manner.\\n\\nIn 7 months I've come through oneitis, lost weight, built muscle, read a ton of books and theory, sorted out my clothes, hair and skin and rekindled my former alpha and outgoing personality from the docile dead husk that it had become. The culmination of all of this sustained and positive action has allowed me to gain my first real and meaningful employment since graduating university 2 years ago. I just got through 7 hours of assessments and interviews in a group of 30 candidates to secure myself a sweet position in the city in a sales based role. \\n\\nA lot of what I read and learned here really came to the forefront over those 7 hours, confidence, enthusiasm, risk taking and above all being ruthlessly Machiavellian in the group tasks. I think getting this job has signaled to me that its time to end my monk mode, and get back in the game. \\n\\nI just felt the need to express my gratitude and let those of you new here know that if you implement what you read, form good habits and consistently commit yourself to improvement across the board, that when you look back in a few months time you wont believe how far you've already come. \\n\\nThanks once again TRP \\n\",\n",

       "  'selftext': '2 months ago I left my old workplace with my boss owing me money. I cleaned a cafe while studying at uni. Aside from not paying me overtime he manipulated me into believing that in order for him to trust me and make sure I didn\\'t go anywhere he would have to hold onto some of my money. Cash in hand, minimum wage, with holding $250 from my first paycheck. I ate that shit up like a beta, not realising what he had done because I was a fucking moron. I wanted to prove to him I was good enough to be there but mostly because I feared not having a job. I quit when I found something better, leaving without notice in a passive-aggressive way of telling him to go fuck himself, but always felt terrible about leaving without my money.\\n\\nEnter the red pill. In realising my own legitimate desires, acknowledging that others are also after power covertly, I noticed how irrational it was for me to fear getting my money back. So I re-entered the cafe today while it was emptying. I asked for my money. He told me \"get the fuck out\". So I told him \"give me my fucking money you snake.\" Standing my ground and staring into his eyes. He told me I\\'d regret it if I didn\\'t leave. I gave him the DiCaprio Wolf of Wallstreet fake laugh in his face and said to him \"What the fuck are you going to do?\"\\n\\nEveryone in there was trembling towards me. The other manager panicked and was saying \"just give him his money\". A passerby lady in assuming I\\'m an irrational aggressor called the cops and got them involved in which I immediately calmed down my adversarial nature and explained my story, how he took my money from me and others and I wanted to call him out for it. I knew that I hadn\\'t done anything illegal but because I was confronting him loudly people assumed I was an abuser. The most satisfying part was that calmly explaining to those not involved what I was doing, the woman who called the police ended up agreeing with my decision to confront him. \"You\\'re actually a nice guy\". \\n\\nTo my boss he understood power. To those watching wanted reason. \\n\\nWhen I ended up leaving the cafe and walking away we locked eyes for the last moment. I nodded at him, and he nodded back.  \\n\\nNow the police have referred me to proper legal advice to bring this douche canoe down for tax evasion. Something which I have a large amount of evidence for. \\n\\nBalls are now made of titanium. Living the dream. I now want to fight bears on a mountain. \\n\\n',\n",

I haven't even been here in like 6 months and things are going pretty well and I feel like I've internalized it. So I thought I'd post a bit of an update.\\n\\nOverall I'd say TRP has been a huge win for me.\\n\\nMy marriage is saved. My wife is submissive, pleasant, and puts out. She's still overweight but that will probably take years to resolve if ever. \\n\\nI had a 2nd round main event. She was starting to slip, saying shit to piss me off, witholding sex, accusing me of shit, basically starting to head back towards the bad old days. I started withholding attention. Going out more. Ignoring her. She flipped out. I remained stoic and flippant. I demonstrated IDGAF and very real OI. Made it clear that I was the captain of this ship and she was welcome to come along for the ride. Or not her choice. She came around fast. We had makeup sex and she gagged herself on my cock.\\n\\nShit tests are like pff whatever go make me a sandwich.\\n\\nSex is way up and better. She loves to be dominated in bed now. She even asks for it.\\n\\nPlus everybody really likes my new muscles. I did stronglifts for 6 mos, got really strong. Now I'm starting an HST program.\\n\\nTRP has really helped me to understand women and power dynamics and myself. Stick with it, boys, it pays dividends.\",\n",

Apparently she keeps in contact with the girl and they are still good friends.  I give her a little game so that she is open to telling me more.  She starts doing that thing girls do where they throw subtle hints out \"it\\'s interesting to see how different you two ended up.\"  \"Comparing where you two are now is crazy.\"\\n\\n\\nSo I trade game and dominance for information and she eventually shows me pictures.  The literal girl of dreams from long ago has turned into a multicolor short haired drug addict essentially.  The exact opposite of what she was with me.\\n\\n\\nI tease her with some \"you were a bad influence on her\" type thing for a while, she keeps swearing she tried as much as she could to keep her from going down this path.  The sad thing is this girl I loved was a genius.  Gifted genetically in almost everyway and extremely privileged in terms of opportunities to go far (high IQ parents, great body/hair, high IQ herself, best education arguably in the state).  Where is she now?  Pizza delivery.  I shit you not.  The girl that got an infinitely higher SAT score than me 2 years younger than me at the time and regularly got letters from ivy league colleges to come visit the campus and see about scholarship opportunities is delivering pizzas while I work as a college graduate in the field of my major.\\n\\n\\nAlways remember that women without a man to guide them *will* end up lost.\\n\\n\\nWhile I\\'m sitting there with her looking at this, I say \" I was such a nice guy to her.\"  She decides to drop the truth bomb, \"you were great to her, but do you really think she wanted a nice guy?  I\\'m just being honest.\"\\n\\n\\nI tease her a little more, keep the kino up in my car.  This girl has some self control.  Even though I see the smiles and the comfort she has with me, she jumps out of the car. I get her number for later.  Maybe we can trade for something other than information next time.\\n\\n\\nThanks guys for teaching me about sexual strategy otherwise I\\'d have ended up with a girl like this.

       "  'selftext': 'To start with, from the bottom of my heart thank you for everything you guys do. For all you give selflessly to give today\\'s men support, direction, and a safe space to be and feel like a man. To the time and patience you show working with us, instructing us, guiding us, and checking us when we need it. You are the shepherds of today\\'s lost men.\\n\\n\\nJanuary 21st of this year. I broke up with my girlfriend of almost exactly two years. She found another man and at least had the decency to be open and honest about it. I also don\\'t blame her or resent her. I was nothing. I had no opinions. No balls. My hobbies I gave up to spend time with her. I stopped seeing my friends to spend time with her, and I stopped being who I was to open my life to her. In other words, she had no reason at all to respect me. When we started dating, I was mildly opinionated, had my finances in decent order, had hobbies, and a social circle. I was enough. By the time we separated I had lost all of that. I was about as pathetic as they come. I let her Cam online and had an open relationship policy only she benefited from. I was completely domesticated. \\n\\n\\nYears ago, while pursuing a woman I had horrific oneitis for I had dabbled in the pickup community. Reading Gambler\\'s \"The Natural\" and it was enough to get me by, but I was not good with women by any means. I could count my partners on one hand(Better than many I know, but that\\'s only because I\\'m naturally charming with a good sense of humor, it landed me some sex on rare occasions, but the sex was terrible and never repeated). After the breakup, I went back to that, to try and bounce back and land on my feet and get back out in the dating game with firm encouragement from a true brother, though not by blood. He wouldn\\'t let me have a mourning period, and I respect him for that. In going back to pickup, I stumbled on TRP. It clicked so instantaneously. Everything made sense. Why I couldn\\'t get women, why they didn\\'t want to sleep with me, how many I was truly orbiting at the time, everything. It all fell into place. There was no denial, and no anger. I devoured information day and night. I shared what I had found with the brother mentioned above and we began our RP journey together. This was loosely by the end of February. Since then, I\\'ve dropped 50lbs, added 35% to my income, fleshed out some muscle, started a business on the side, and started gaming women, and my social circle exploded. I\\'ve only just begun this journey and I\\'ve made something of myself I never thought I would achieve. I can\\'t remember the last time I went a week without sex, and I\\'m juggling three women. If you would have told me I was capable of that a year ago, I would have laughed in your face and tried to have you committed for being delusional. u/Archwinger u/GayLubeOil u/Rollo-Tomassi u/dr_warlock u/IllimitableMan u/OmLaLa u/redpillschool and so many others. You men have saved a life. I had planned previously to simply drink myself to death and was well on my way, I would have been lucky if I lived to see 30, and every day was just me being depressed while I couldn\\'t understand the world around me. Today, I\\'m looking forward to the rest of my 20\\'s, my 30\\'s, and every single year I can squeeze out with the biggest shit eating grin on my face because I know how much potential is there. \\n\\n\\nLast night prompted me to write this. I led a night on the town with a group of around 20 people and I was king. I led, I decided, and every woman in the group was eating out of my hand. I could choose who I was sleeping that night, and I did. I felt what it was like to be the uncontested Alpha of the group and it spun off to everyone around us at every bar we hit who could see it clearly as well. It was truly a feeling I can\\'t even put into words, and I owe that bliss to you men.\\n\\n\\nThe real reason I have to thank you however, is because I found something I don\\'t know if I ever had in the first place. Self respect. I have boundaries. I have rules. I\\'m the most important thing in my life and nobody can ever take that away from me. I not only love who I am, I love what I am becoming and every day of self improvement snowballs that feeling.\\n\\n\\nOne last time, thank all of you so much. Thank you to every single contributor who shares their knowledge and experience, and thank you to every single moderator who keeps this space safe from the threats inside and out. Keep doing what you\\'re doing because believe it or not, you are changing the world. One man at a time.',\n",

I\\'m already muscular but idc, I can always improve. \\n\\n\\n\\nMet another girl and I immediately approached her differently. I judged her with my brain and not my dick and was always vigilant for red flags. A few things I did differently were I embraced my sexuality and drive as a man, I made it clear I wouldn\\'t take any shit from her (bitchy complaints will not be tolerated), and I did what I wanted when I wanted and if she wanted to join along she could, if I wanted. \\n\\n\\n\\nI am in the first healthy relationship of my life thanks to the captain and first mate rule. I\\'m the captain of the relationship and she is aware of her place as my first mate. There was a thread about red flags and green flags on TRP I read and I immediately internalized them and almost scientifically studied her. **Watch her actions and don\\'t listen to her words.** Low partner count (1 before me and it was a serious relationship), did not join a sorority in college nor ride the cock carousel, does not go out and party and get hammered, parents are still together and have a healthy relationship, not alpha widowed, low social media usage, does not stuff her face in her phone, has a personality, is comfortable with me concealed carrying while on dates, my best friend approves (he\\'s natural red pill in my opinion) and he\\'s given me good advice on nexting girls in the past, can cook, and is supportive of me, my passions and my career (navy). Any others I should keep in mind please let me know. \\n\\n\\n\\nRed Pill rules I still am aware of while in a relationship with her: the hamster; oneitis, she is not the end all be all of my life nor a unicorn but I am exclusive with her while maintaining my independence; alpha widow, still making sure she was in fact not alpha widowed; shit tests, it took me a long time to realize what these are and now I just blow them away and the easiest way I realized how to pass them was the use of sarcasm; comfort tests, still getting used to these so I\\'ve slipped a few times but I\\'m more aware now and pass them; I never try to show her TRP or explain my knowledge of it; never show my hand so to speak, 48 laws of power, multiple laws; and making sure I am in fact her 2nd partner and she didn\\'t lowball me on her number.  \\n\\n\\n\\nBonus points: I\\'ve met her parents and her dad respects me as a man; her mom shit tests me in front of her and I pass the living shit out of those in front of her. \\n\\n\\n\\nThis is just a simple thanks to TRP but I am a lifelong learner and if there is anything else I should keep in mind that can be immediately recommended I will be grateful.

Fact: not all girls are going to take a liking to me. \\n\\n today, im going to go to a community fall festival and enjoy myself (probably hit on some girls, no doubt), come home and watch some football games, have to go into work for a bit this afternoon and go to church band practice this evening.  then tonight, im going to do whatever the fuck i want.  life is good, thanks to TRP and thanks to everyone.

       "  'selftext': \"tl;dr A guy started the right way, but got lost, and lost everything and is now finding his way back to the path older and wiser.\\n\\nI think this will be a bit long, but it's my introduction for myself to the group.  I am 39 years old  and I am amazed at the wreckage of my life up to this point.\\n\\nI was variously a social outcast and very popular growing up.  I was a prototypical nice kid.  I tried very hard to get along with everyone.  Looking back I was mostly either forgotten or forgettable.\\n\\nI did well enough to get accepted to several colleges.  My parents didn't have any money to help me go to them.  After getting my AS in Engineering from college, I decided that I had enough sitting in class.  So I decided to join the Army and get out of my parents home.  I then met a girl that seemed in to me for the first time in my life and I was completely taken and in love, so yeah, you know how this ends.\\n\\nIn the Army, at first I worked very hard not to be noticed.  You know, the soldier that passes his tests and follows orders, but you wouldn't even notice other than a check box in the Army's vast bureaucracy.  I changed tact and decided to do things to get notice.  Always do more than what the orders required and be proactive.  That got me promoted fast.  I was normally balancing two or three girls, I didn't realize how good life was, no one had ever heard of red pill in 1997.  The girl from the above paragraph contacted me, we decided we were still in love and that we should get married.\\n\\nI wanted to start our family she said I had to get out of the Army and let her finish her degree.  I agreed to all of it and tolerated living apart for a year and a half while she completed her degree, which became two and a half years.  She went through several men that knew she was married, none of them including her cared, I didn't know unitl later and was celibate and pining for her the whole time.  My career suffered because I knew I would not be re-enlisting.  We had an agreement that once I got out of the Army and she completed her degree, it would be my turn.  Yeah, right, your on your own bub.\\n\\nWe finally moved in together again, I had a little time left in the Army.  I was anxious to make up for all the time we had been apart.  She literally made me feel like a rapist, three or four times, and that was enough to cool off my enthusiasm, if not entirely my libido.  I decided to start trying to do enough to make her happy so that maybe she would want sex with me.  \\n\\nSex got rare, and then suddenly improved, and yep a little girl was born.  Then sex got very rare again.  Somewhere I decided I had to be the ultimate people pleaser, never a problem to my employer or my wife so that my wife wouldn't leave me in the situation where I didn't get to see my kid again.  I started taking care of myself, secretly sick of my situation, and soon she decided to have a second kid, a little boy.  Sex became all but non-existent, at best once every three months.  I had learned not to even consider trying to initiate.  Some of the posts on r/dead_bedroom applied to our marriage.  It turned into a sham.  I spent time with the kids.  She spent all her time in bed.  I lost my job when the contracts dried up and cut backs were made at the plant I worked at in 2009.  After that I was always hustling to make a little money.\\n\\nAnyway, one day she decided she wanted me out of the house.  Any woman can tell a few little white lies and have a man removed from his house.  This is modern justice.  I was separated from my kids, and they were hidden from me for months.  At one point, I goaded her father into taking a swing at me in front of witnesses and put him in the hospital, not really my proudest moment.\\n\\nI wound up living in a trailer in back of a friends house with no water or electricity.  I was suicidal from lack of contact with my kids.  I took whatever jobs I could find, clearing fence line, working on small engines, horse taming, roofing, minor electrical and plumbing work, whatever made it so that I didn't go hungry that night.  In a way, what my exwife did was the first dose of red pill, this was in a way my second.  I managed to buy and old truck and rebuild it using my friends tools.  That  let me get more work and my own tools, then an apartment.  That was really living.  I started studying to get certifications and rapidly got them and a job to go along with it.  Somewhere in here I stumbled across MGTOW and red pill.  \\n\\nI was starting to think of a bigger apartment when my exwife learned through contacts that I had gotten off my back when she hit me for child support/back child support.  She had the best lawyer in town.  I showed up in sweats.  I told the judge that I really didn't have anything more than a pile of debts, but she had hidden my kids from me and I wanted 50/50 custody now that I could afford a place for them, while pointing out that I had struggled to make $800/month in the previous six months and had receipts and IRS filings to prove it.  The judge mostly ruled in my favor and gave me two weeks to prove to the court that I had arrangements for my kids.  I hustled and found a place.  The funny thing is that she has to pay me child support, I put her through college.\\n\\nI had my kids every other week and was much happier.  I was also in monk mode, never working out, and couldn't figure out what I was missing.  My wife had taught me how bad a woman can and will hurt you, just because they can and they want to do so.\\n\\nI studied more red pill, started working out again.  Started paying attention to my clothes.  Went back to a policy of trying to do more than what is required at work, because I want to.  I even started college again, my kids and I all sit around the table and study.  I am looking into starting my own business, but I want to finish college first, the certifications and the degree with my experience will make sure I never live hand to mouth again.  \\n\\nI realized that I was craving to get laid again.  I went out and started doing simple approaches wherever I could.  The club, the coffeehouse, the bookstore became favorite places.  My goal was not directly to get laid so much as to change my environment to one in where I knew a lot of women and could work at things a little indirectly.  Now, I'm back to where I was in the army in the early days.  I have a few women that I can call out almost any time, for fun or sex or whatever.  I just got promoted for the second time in less than two years at work.  Life is good, and if I hadn't stumbled across the red pill in my darkest hours, I may have crossed that final line.  I'm really glad I didn't.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"**TL;DR** I'm a recovering drug addict, and TRP is a huge part of my recovery.  Thanks!\\n\\nI actually begun my TRP journey with a pretty pathetic post - I got some good responses that helped me give myself a slap in the face and think about things straight.  I think I was just having a low point, just barely recovered from a back injury which had reduced me to the point of immobility for 4 days, drinking beers every night, barely moving, eating tonnes of shitty food out of boredom.  All I was doing was wasting time watching youtube and that's basically where I was coming from (how I actually found TRP).\\n\\nAnyways the positives that I wasn't thinking of at the time were that I am still a recovering drug addict, and compared to where I was at 7 months ago when I finally quit, I've made leaps and bounds in every category of life.\\n\\nI haven't been lifting the whole time, but honestly my body was not ready for it yet.  The day I quit I began following the Convict Conditioning program by Paul Wade, working on stage1 of each exercise.  This was great for my shoulders which I seemed to have problems with for many years (I could do straight up pushups but would always screw up my shoulder so it wasn't worth it, never thought of doing the  small progressions approach offered in Paul Wade's program).  So now after about 5 months of following that quite closely I began some lifting/jogging again in the gym which feels great.  I've been having nice slow steady gains since I started, but it's taking some time to burn off some fat I've had for a while but at this rate it will be gone within a year.\\n\\nAs far as the addiction recovery side of things, over the past 6 months I've had ups and downs and many times where I wanted so badly to go to them that I fell off the wagon for days at a time but would always get back on the horse within a week or so.  I'm part of an awesome group where sober people help eachother stay sober, and we also help people get sober.  This is the main reason I'm still on track, but around the time I started reading TRP I can honestly say that those cravings have diminshed almost altogether finally.  I think it's a matter of keeping me focused on my real goals of getting stronger, bigger, trimming down, and finishing my education goals as my ABSOLUTE priority.  And thinking less about short term gratification, which I get now from jogger's high which is 100 times better than a relapse would be anyway.  A lot of these changes happened before TRP but just because my journey started before TRP doesn't mean it's not a huge help.\\n\\nSo thanks for all the helpful advice and posts.\",\n",

Now I feel like anything is possible, its an immense amount of weight of my chest.\\n\\nI know there are tons of thank you posts here, mines just another drop in the bucket, but I hope you guys know how much of a difference you're making for people.  None of you have to spend so much time doing this stuff but you do it anyways, I dont know why but I want you to know it's working.\\n\\nedited for spelling\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hey guys, i just found out about TRP a week ago and been reading it up probably 2-3 hours a day, it has really helped my confidence and motivation, for the past week i hit the gym 6/7 days and changed my hairstyle and clothing, i am 5'11 and 204 lbs. i am aiming for 180 lbs. and to gain alot of muscle, i've always had this TRP mindset for dating, men and woman in general but always thought it was crazy talk. After finding out that i'm actually not alone it increased my motivation for the future immensely! Also i just turned 18 and am in my first year of community college. I am planning a 6 month plan for the gym and working on game and self mindfulness. I will make a post every month to give you guys my progress, and a list of goals as I've only slept with 2 woman in my lifetime so far and want to increase the number drastically while maintaining a healthy mind and body.\\n\\nPlease post tips and any good readings a beginner like me should read.\",\n",

I\\'m, for the first time in my life, considered skinny. I have a little pooch that I know will go away if I keep up with my calorie intake and exercise. I\\'m just stoked to be in tighter pants and throwing away all my old clothes. I never realized how *obvious* 30 lbs is until you compare photos.\\n\\nNot just that, but I\\'ve managed my eating. For fun, I\\'ve monitored how long it takes me to get hungry to the point I can no longer ignore it and it\\'s amazing that I often ate 3 square meals a day. Now I find myself eating only what I need to keep going or to produce gains.\\n\\nI\\'ve found my inner strength through exercising. I push myself and ignore all other distractions. I\\'m in no way where I want to be with my muscles yet. \\n\\nI\\'ve reclaimed my balls by cutting off or ignoring people who benefited me in no way. I often deactivate facebook for long periods of time to get shit done and only activate it when something important needs to be announced or checked. I\\'ve been approaching and getting #\\'s and getting rejected. Rejection is no big deal. It happens and I\\'m glad I\\'m embracing that nothing-ness. \\n\\nI\\'m entering the IDGAF mindset subconsciously without having to think about how IDGAF. With that, I\\'m in the bargaining phase. Where \"if I just keep approaching, keep lifting, keep living, maybe I\\'ll get some pussy\". It\\'s funny but it\\'s true. \\n\\nThanks to TRP I\\'ve realized how far my head has been up women\\'s ass. Even when I got pussy in relationships, it\\'s no reason to lose your individuality. Even in the beginning of TRP when I was pulling in just a few chicks, I was *zoned in* on trying to pull them in. Now I do things like check when their last text or snapchat was sent and I\\'m like \"naw, she can wait another day\". It\\'s fun and they still reply immediately. \\n\\nSo I\\'ve done a lot of self-analysis and come to a lot of peace with where I am. I\\'m at that point where I can hit up people to see if anyone wants to hang but be perfectly content with reading a book or indulging in an hour or 2 of mindless SNES games because I\\'ve accomplished everything I wanted to out of my day. I\\'m letting things just be while I work on me.\\n\\nThanks again TRP. ',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I am about three months in: read course prereqs, much of sidebar. Whew. The more I learn, the less I know. Anyway, wife and daughters came back from a two day trip I arranged and paid for months ago. Upon arriving back home, she is very cool towards me. No idea why, but I don\\'t ask. Before RP, I would have. Now IDGAF. That night, I wake her up from a sound sleep and initiate sex, but she is all tense and just laying there and not giving me anything back so I stop and pull out. Her: \"Whats wrong?\" Me: \"This isn\\'t working for me. You\\'re all tense and just laying there\" very non chalant. I role over and go to sleep as it is late. First time I have EVER done this. Wasn\\'t sure if I had the nerve, to be perfectly honest. But I am glad I did.\\nThe next day, I aome home from work and she was tentative around me. After dinner she says, \"I need to talk to you later.\"\\nMe: \"Lets talk now. Put on something loose and feminine and meet me on the front porch.\" (She is still in her SAHM work clothes. I walk out to the porch. Ten minutes later, she re appears in a loose and feminine sundress. So far so good)\\nI tell her \"Okay , you\\'ve got 15 minutes. Shoot.\" She raises an eyebrow at that, but makes no comment.\\nTo summarize, the discussion was under 15 minutes. She leveled several emotional accusations against me (I am being demeaning, arrogant, any other woman would walk away, etc). I remained calm, held frame, and ended with amused mastery and humor. She also raised some concerns about how I am rougher in bed lately, and how it is making her \"bleed\" down there. That was pure bullshit, and I exposed it as such with ease. The last time I banged her was Sunday and she gave every sign of enjoyment, and I found no stains on the bed linen. I told her \"Its nothing I have\\'t done before, but its been a while so you\\'ll get used to it.\" Subject was dropped forthwith. Before she could think of anything else, I asked her if she was wearing any underwear. She said yes. I mock critisized her for raising such an important topic with me while wearing underwear, and how disrespectful that was. She laughed. Then I grabbed her hand and said \"Its a nice evening. Lets take a drive in the country.\" Her: \" I\\'m not wearing any shoes.\" Me\" \"So?\"\\nI stick my head in the front door and tell my oldest we are taking off for a while. Off we go in my car for a scenic drive in the country. (Sidenote: I have been doing this with her all summer; taking her for little spontaneous jaunts. I go a little farther from home each time and she has not shoes, purse, or cellphone. All she has is the dress on her back. I found I enjoyed this because it is helping to break down her inhibitions. For the duration of the trip, she is vulnerable and totally in my power. At first she was very reluctant and scared. Now she comes with me with nary a word.)\\nI\\'m pleased and amazed with my progress so far, yet conscious that I have a long way to go. I am grateful for this site and for a select few other sites. I have not had a fight with wife now for three months, and my wife and children are more and more responding to my vibe and following my lead. I\\'m working out (lifting &amp; short intense cardio), feeling great. Upgraded wardrobe, spoke to wife about finances, told her if she goes back to work for a year, we will be able to finally pay off some old debts and move towards some long term financial goals. She agreed, and is going to start next week at a job I found for her. She is not thrilled about it, but she is doing it. ( Watch what they do, not what they say\" Indeed!) I am never going back to the shrill BP beta bitch I turned into. Lessons learned? don\\'t get complacent, hold frame at all costs, avoid deep or lengthy conversations, and forge ahead with OI. Never look back.',\n",

Thank you for your support.  I could not have done this without you, because I wouldn\\'t know of this without you.\\n\\nThe best thing is that I know my wife is having sex now because she wants to.  She actively seeks it, she moans like I have never heard...she makes sexual jokes...she seems happier.  I told me wife \"We should do something this weekend\" and she replied \"Yeah, have sex doggy style, twice :)\"  I mean, I was happy to get sex once a week and now it happens twice a night.  You guys taught me how to get the sex I wanted, by not asking for the sex I wanted.  I have lost 22 lbs and I notice that there is a positive correlation between weight loss and confidence gained.  I am glad at 26, I got this down and I look forward to the rest of my marriage.  Thanks guys.  \\n\\nP.S. I am also a Provisionally Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist.

The foundation i live by has changed dramatically in the last 6 months since i've found TRP. \\n\\nWhile these all may be just words to live by, understand that the foundation of a mindset can be a powerful thing. Man’s brain evolved such a thing in order to ensure success in a dangerous and competitive environment. \\n\\nThat is what a dedicated mindset is able to accomplish. I got out and learned how to unicycle in 1 day. Want to know how? I spent more time riding the unicycle on my own rather than by using support. Want it so bad that you’d be willing to fall 50 - 100 times before getting it down. 1-2 years ago i would have lost focus after 20 - 30 times. Now i LIFT.\\n\\nI’d like to mention ANTIFRAGILE by Nassim Taleb. This book shows that system feeds off of disorder and stress, resulting in potential growth. Welcome the fall and learn from it. That’s the only way TO learn by pushing off from your mom’s tits and learn by experience. \\n\\nI’ve got a lot more to mention today. Some of which resolves around Rule 36 of the 48 Laws of Power, but here’s a list of books that have helped me along the way;\\n\\nThe Rational Male (Preventative Medication and the original) - Rollo Tomassi\\nAntifragile - Nassim Taleb\\nThe Way of Men - Jack Donovan\\nThe 48 Laws of Power - Robert Greene \\nNo More Mr. Nice Guy - Dr. Robert A. Glover\\nGorilla Mindset - Mike Cernovich\\n\\nShout-out to Mike Cernovich over at Danger and Play. He runs a great blog that i’m not associated with.\\n\\nTomorrow i'll follow up with a post on rule 36. (Be grateful for the things you have, disdain the things you can't have). I'm not spending more than 30 mins. on this.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I'm the guy who's ex g/f threw away 4 years and a lifetime to give her virginity to some random at a business camp. (see my post history if you want to know more).\\n\\nI originally posted on /r/relationships and I got a lot of feedback from people over there.  However the admins of that sub are just whack in how they run things.  They deleted my posts and would lock my thread and even told me to stop posting about this on there (I had only posted twice) so a site I thought was supposed to help me didn't do anything.\\n\\nHowever because of those posts I was contacted by several guys who said they were from the red pill.  Guys that were telling me their story's and letting me know I wasn't alone and what they did to get better.\\n\\nMy Uncle also gave me proper advice as well.\\n\\nI looked at the main site and devoured the side bar.  I bought and read the rational male and I have been taking in as much of the site as I can get.\\n\\nI have been lifting solid for a month now.  Even though I have moved into college I was able to immediately get into the college's gym here and even have the benefit of a trainer for free as long as I can be here between 5-7 which I can.\\n\\nGuys I can already feel a difference, my cloths are looser at the waist line but getting tight in the chest and arms.  I've added 7 pounds to my reps and I've upped my cardio to 35 min. a day.\\n\\nMy goal is to adding 20 lbs by Christmas and change up the cardio to 20 elliptical and 20 stair climber.\\n\\nI have changed my diet, right now I am doing all low carb stuff and drinking protein shakes at both morning time and right after I work out.\\n\\nRight now I am in full monk mode.  Meaning I am not looking at or giving two shits about women here at college.  I've had a couple already give me their numbers and want to text but I'm not ready yet and I have to get my mind in tune with my body.\\n\\nWhen I come out of this mode, again probably around Christmas time, I intend to be a fucking black knight slayer. \\n\\nI still have a lot and I mean a lot of work to do on that end though.  I have been brought up all of my life to want relationship/house/family all of that bullshit.  So its not something I can just do away with in one month.\\n\\nIts getting easier but I have to make sure that I don't make the immediate mistake of going after a girl and actually trying to beta treat her into a relationship.  I have zero intention of EVER and I mean FUCKING EVER giving anyone that type of power over me ever again.\\n\\nOne month ago I was so low that I'm not going to lie and say that I thought about ending it for the briefest of time.  I never would have done it but it was so hard initially that's where I felt like going.  But now I'm not healed all the way but thanks to this site, this information and frankly to Rollo Tomassi I am on my way to a better me.  One day I may even look back and be happy she did this to me, I'm certainly not there yet though.\\n\\nAs to her, fuck her I don't give two shits about her and I have made it clear t my family and friends that I do not want to hear about her or be told anything about her nor are they to pass anything on from her to me.  I will hang up the phone and not answer any return calls from anyone trying to do so if they are family and will call them back when I deem fit.  And if a friend does it then they have been told in no uncertain terms that they will be former friends.  However all of our friends stand with me on this, even her female friends took my side.\\n\\nAnyway, thank you from the bottom of my heart.  The fucker who asked me if I wanted to be the guy who loved a girl for four years but got nothing but heart ache or be the guy who banged two chicks at camp in a week lit the match that fired my fuse and I have no doubt he was from the red pill\",\n",

About 2 years ago I was a depressed, fat feminist girl who had a bad attitude (based on self loathing) and really needed a guy. I stumbled on the redpill forums and began reading.  \\n\\nEven though I hated what redpill people said, deep down I knew it was true. I shed the fat, gained more self respect. I let my ugly short hair grow out long and let the edgy blue hair dye fade away. I got a new wardrobe and began online dating.  \\n\\nI went on a lot of awful dates but this one guy really stuck out to me. He was handsome, dressed well. He initiated the conversation, he was funny and we had a nice time. One thing that I noticed was he asked me what I wanted for dinner and when the waiter came over he ordered for me which I was impressed with. He held the door for me and paid for me and seemed both totally confident and like a gentleman. Also, the first time we kissed, he pinned my arms back and kissed me and I just felt....taken. I really did find an alpha guy. I ended up falling for him :p We dated for 9 months more and here I am today! I am going to be a wife and eventually mother instead of a lonely feminist.

I assumed I had more in common with men.   And using my own head, could not understand the appeal of the waif-like figure I have – because what on earth is attractive about something that looks flimsy and weak?  And everyone knows that cleavage is the most attractive thing on a woman, because all men think about is sex, right?    \\n\\nIf I am not attractive to me, and I think like a man, then I am not attractive.    \\n\\nBut I am not thinking like a man, I am completely misunderstanding the nuances in the male/female dynamic.  No I am not a naturally girly girl.  I am a naturally logical thinker, that is why I cannot deny the truths about women set out in TRP, no matter if they seem unpalatable at first.  And that is why I can now appreciate what it is that a man really looks for in a female partner.  And not put his heart-felt desires to love and protect a woman down to evil patriarchal control freakery.  To understand the true nature of submission, and to feel safe trusting my husband to be my captain.  \\n\\nI am finally free to enjoy 'being a woman' in these little ways that logic and feminism told me were frivolous and silly and therefore stupid and pointless.   \\n\\nOften I find things work in the opposite manner in which you expected them to.

Erectyle dysfunction: I can't get it up for a woman, I can only get it up to porn (I never had a morning wood - try to imagine that). I wired my brain to see women as useless. I don't have any drive to talk to women anymore. Here is the use I make of women: I look at them. When I see a woman, I'm not driven to fuck her, just to look at her and to masturbate while thinking about her. Women are not sexual partners anymore, they are only something that I use to get off while masturbating. As I never had a lot of sex (1 sexual partner only), my brain thinks masturbation is the way to fullfill my sexual needs. Women are of no use to me anymore, I fuck my right hand while looking at some women on my screen. This is how I taught my brain that I could get dopamine, orgasm and what's the closest to a sexual relationship I ever had. Neurons that fire together wire together. My social and sexual life has always been empty. This intense masturbating habbit also took a toll on my health: exhausted, weak, which influenced my mental health. \\n\\n* **My tv/computer/movie consumption** Since I was twelve I spent all my free time on the internet. I taught myself to use it as a crush. \\n\\n* **Professional life** I will graduate in june 2016, if I don't get expelled (I'm in a very tough situation). My degree is not useless (engineering) but I am in one of the worst school and I learned nothing in college. I already began to look for jobs but no one wants to hire me as an engineer because of my empty CV and my lack of conection. \\n\\nWhen I'm sad, I flee away from reality with video games. When I feel lonely, I masturbate instead of talking to girls. The teenage years are when one gets the tools that will helps him navigate through life. I got myself very poor tools. My health is ruined, I have no wealth, my social and sexual life has always been non existent. \\n\\nTRP taught me new tools: lift, read, eat healthy and sleepe well. I added other tools of my own to create a system. But God, it's so hard. With my poor health that prevents me from doing huge efforts and the fact that those useless and harmful habbits has been implemented for all my fucking life...\\n\\nI have no skills, I never achieved anything (no exageration), have an empty CV, doesn't even have my driver licence...I am very skilled at video games and magic cards though.\\n\\nEverything I do has to change, from the way I work, to the way I eat, sleep, talk to people, I am a complete mess. \\n\\nThank you for making me realize how much of a piece of shit I am.  \",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Sup fuckers,\\n\\n I want to say that not all of us are betas, and yet TRP helps us too. My whole life I knew most of this shit, but to be honest had never connected the dots before. Seeing it all in one place, it makes a coherent bigger picture that allowed me to see things completely in a way I had never considered before.\\n\\nIve never had a hard time getting 7s 8s and 9s, and true shit Im a 6\\' 3\" heavy set viking with a full beard. Ive just always been pretty silver tongued, absolutely FEARLESS, and just a little bit funny. That\\'s been enough to allow me to filter my fair share of fish from the stream.\\n\\n I think I had to earn my man card early in life, and carried myself with a solid frame most of the time, and my share of chicks vibed on that. I\\'m not a successful player by any means, a part-time pussy slayer at best probably, but I\\'m not afraid to invite a hottie out of my league to come back to my place so I can tie her up with 50\\' of silk rope and give her a good paddling either.  (youd be amazed how often that works.)\\n\\nWhat  TRP has been doing for me is  connecting the dots between a lot of bullet points I think I had cued in on years ago without realizing it. Seeing it all here connects those dots into that complete picture dudes take years to figure out how to see on their own, and makes the whole concept of \"manhood\" easier to understand.\\n\\nHOLY SHIT! I cant stop thinking about it now either. I see TRP everywhere, in everything today.\\n\\n Its like the fuckin Matrix.\\n\\nAnyway, Ive been married a long time, and I don\\'t need to hunt new pussy anymore (I\\'m to old to invest that much energy into a new woman, or give enough fucks to invest enough energy into even fucking one) but I for sure am glad to have this much insight into the \"enemies\" mind, and see dudes coming up with clear guides and articles to teach our younger and beta boys how to act like men. I feel like I woke up with an awakening super powered advantage over like 50% of the worlds population now.\\n\\nKeep it up TRP. You aint getting me no pussy, but you for sure make it easier to hold my frame during shit tests now that I can see them for what they are.\\n\\nThanks you, you glorious bastards.',\n",

I didnt swallow it completely because I couldnt. \\n\\nToday though, it just clicked. My father is a red pill man, but my mother made me blue pill. My father raised me to be the best man he could make me and I just ignored him due to this bull shit feminist society having a stronger influence on me.

       "  'selftext': 'Throughout high school I was not very social at all. I had never dated anyone other than some druggy classmate who forced herself on me after I reluctantly agreed to \"go out\" with her after her druggy friends in my classes kept pushing me to do it. I was involved in a sport and in some of the arts but ended up dropping out junior year to go to online school after I became too physically and mentally ill to meet the attendance requirements largely due to some sexual abuse I suffered from earlier on. I played video games whenever I wasn\\'t at school. I was depressed and extremely anxious to the point where I was nauseous, throwing up at least once a day from it. I never thought about the future, figuring it was only a matter of time before my illnesses or my suicidal thoughts would lead to my death, which I looked forward to so long as I didn\\'t have to make my family suffer from knowing I was suicidal.\\n\\nI met a girl who went to my old high school right after I left and we started dating about immediately. We lasted 5 years. We dated the whole time I was going to college for a somewhat useless degree. Her presence made me not as depressed, which let me function like a somewhat normal human. A few weeks after she got back from an overseas trip, and a few days after I graduated with honours from college she broke up with me, saying the only reason was that I didn\\'t have enough ambition. I was baffled because I had the most ambition I had ever had throughout our relationship. A little before this breakup I had read up on The Red Pill. This allowed me to recognize the reality that she likely road the CC while overseas and was looking for ways to justify that by placing the blame on me. **I decided not to care**.\\n\\nAfter that, instead of falling back into the mental illnesses that I had prior to the relationship, I ended up cutting my video gaming down, and increased my hiking, travelling, bicycling, camping, and fishing. I stopped caring if other people loved me or not and began loving myself. I live an active lifestyle now, though I don\\'t \"work out\" so my body still isn\\'t much to be desired imo.\\n\\nSo about a year and a half after my ex and I broke up I am loving life thanks to the philosophy and advice The Red Pill offers, when my life otherwise likely would have returned right back to sickness and suicide. Better yet, earlier this week I went on my first real \"date\" with a girl I asked out. I messed up plenty of times during it but I enjoyed myself, and that\\'s all that matters to me. Later this week I\\'m going out with another girl I just asked out. Now I\\'ll get them spinning while I\\'m improving my self.\\n\\n\\n\\n&gt;I decided not to care.\\n\\nI want to point this out. I actively made the decision that I would not care. I felt the disgust and all that, but I quickly realized that I didn\\'t have to feel that way. So I made the decision that made it not matter. The girl I thought I had been with did not exist and truly never did exist. Now, I still experienced  a \"mourning\" state, but deciding not to care got rid of any wanting that I would have had to get back together, and it allowed me to focus on myself instead of my loss. It allowed me to realize my love was a delusion - and a continuation of the mental illnesses that had ruined my life before.\\n\\nThanks TRP!',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"#TLDR: thanks TRP for giving me game and a quality life.\\n\\nLast weekend I went out with this girl I met. Super cute girl. We went out for drinks with a group of friends. I went to get us another round and came back, she was all Chatty Cathy with a beta boy who was listening to her complain about religion and how the colleges in America are party focused and she isn't about that. We meet these models who recognize me from Instagram, and I them from ads in the city I live in (a major US city) and we start talking.\\n\\nThe next bar we go to she is still chatty with that bro, but these new girls are easily 9's. While the girl before was a 7/8. So we leave the bar without the first girl. I'm sure her new guy took care of her, idk I never heard from her again but wasn't sweating it with this model around my arm.\\n\\nFast forward to the next week, we text a little bit. Mostly logistic texting, when and where to get together next. Dancing is a good one to go with because you don't really talk, it's very physical and you can drink having fun. \\n\\nWe get to the bar at this dance hall, I order her drink for her and get a beer. A round of shots. I tell her she orders the next round (she did).\\n\\nUsually whenever I order for the girl I always say vodka with Pinneapple, or cranberry, or something sweet for the girl. Bartenders usually know what to do.\\n\\nIt was fun, after a few hours we go back to my place and I invite her in. I close. Afterwards she was telling me how fun it was, how hot I am and how my body is killer. Ever since starting the red pill back in April I've been hitting the gym hard and it's paying off. She told me she can tell I really work hard at the gym and I was super stoked.\\n\\nShe left soon after that. \\n\\nIt was a fun evening, but it wouldn't have happen if I didn't know the game plan from TRP. So. I'm stoked. Thanks TRP.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hey everyone,\\n\\nJust like all of you, I\\'ve had my fair share of trouble trying to figure out how to act and how to treat certain people in this world.  For far too long, I have had the beta mindset.  I have always been a people pleaser thinking that it would make people like me.  I\\'ve always given in too easily as well.  If something seemed to I would give up almost instantly.  \\n\\nFor years I looked up to people who seemed cool and confident with themselves and always wished I could be like that.  I just never thought that it would be possible for me.  I\\'ve always felt like I was easy to break, and for some reason I\\'ve been okay with that.  \\n\\nI guess you can say that my childhood situation was really beta training mode for me.  My parents divorced when I was 5 and I spent my entire life in the middle of the two of them.  I was always caught in the middle of every fight and also had to listen to each parent talk shit about the other.  It drove me insane and still does till this day.  After seeing how my parents treated each other, I promised myself that I would good to all my future SO\\'s and basically treat them like a fucking princess(bad, I know).  \\n\\nBut it wasn\\'t just the fighting between them that took a toll on me.  I became a fat kid after my parents split.  They were always in competition with each other to impress me.  My mom would essentially make me steak and potatoes every night for dinner while my dad would usually take me out for McDonald\\'s or wings followed by banana splits.  They just kept spending all their money trying to impress me and in return, I became a complete spoiled brat.  \\n\\nMy mother was also very sheltering.  Even when I was a senior in high school, I wasn\\'t allowed to spend time at a friend\\'s house unless their was adult supervision.  Hell, even after graduation college she would get pissed if I went to the bar ONE per week, while I was working my ass off at two jobs.  While my father has always given me much more freedom, he\\'s never been able to help defend me when it comes to shit with my mom.  He would just make some joke about how controlling she is and then laugh it off.  When I wanted to get my four wheeler all decked out and start amateur motocross, my mom quickly slammed the gavil down for a big old NO.  Shit, even when my dad tought me how to shoot a 22 she flipped out despite the fact that she used to shoot guns and go hunting. \\n\\nUnfortunately it wasn\\'t until a couple of months ago that I realized things need to change.  I was in a LTR with someone who I had been good friends with for awhile.  Honestly, if I hadn\\'t been such a bitch, things may have worked out.  I wanted to spend way too much time than was healthy for a relationship, but I figured that if I didn\\'t she would lose interest(I\\'m a real Einstein).  She would actually be open an honest about my neediness and clinginess because she wanted me to change.  I had always felt like she would get mad and leave me if I would ever give my own opinion on certain things, so I would always just agree with her.  Anyways, whats done is done and is in the past, but it was a wake up call.\\n\\nLittle by little, I\\'ve been using things I\\'ve found on TRP to make myself a better life.  One of the biggest things I\\'ve done is give up on the \"Maybe someday I\\'ll trying do that....\" mentalilty an now try to find a way to do what I want to do.  I\\'ve been playing drums my entire life and want to branch into other instruments and want to learn to sing, so I\\'ve been checking around my area for lessons and have been making phone calls.  I\\'ve sat around for the past 5 years working the same shitty job and smoking lots of herb every day.

       "  'selftext': 'TLDR: 24 year old nice guy (TM), a child of an abusive mother, has woken up to the fact that the female classmate from college he once considered his \\'best friend\\' was based on a lie. Don\\'t be that guy (at least, that guy before he wakes up)\\n\\nIt is with absolutely brutal honesty that I so desperately wanted to hate you guys. The mainstream media, blogs, and various people have branded this subreddit as a hate group, misogynist, fascist, and whatever labels the politically correct elite like to throw at their rivals. Yet, as the allegory suggests, the more I dug deeper into this subreddit, the less I am able to do so, and the more my resentment gets redirected at the politically correct narrative. The rabbit hole just gets deeper and deeper.\\n\\nTo give an abridged version of my life: I grew up with a rather abusive mother and an extremely passive, nice father (who I won\\'t talk too badly about, because he has been nothing but extremely supportive of me in many ways). \\n\\nShe would beat me if I did wrong, which was fair. Children are in need of discipline. When I ended up in my teens, the beatings got more frequent, worse, and for more trivial reasons. Whenever someone would try to stand up for me (my grandmother, or my father), she would have ways of ensuring my undying loyalty (\"your grandmother doesn\\'t care for you like I do\" or \"your father is a slovenly fool who has no idea how to treat children\")\\n\\nThe story of my abusive mother is one for another time, and would take up another post. I would like to focus on my dealings with my so-called female friend.\\n\\nTo give a background, I grew up in a very liberal part of the country, where we were taught to respect women, to worship the ground they walked on, and to always give them the benefit of the doubt. This contradicted the horrible girls I\\'ve met in my life, one of them bullying me by kicking me and hitting me (yes, sad, I know), but I nevertheless held fast to those beliefs.\\n\\nIn college I met a sweet girl. She had similar tastes in music and games and whatnot. We hit it off pretty well (or so I thought, I had absolutely no idea how to talk to girls at the time). I was a trademark, USDA-certified, fedora-wearing Nice Guy (TM) at the time and thought things would progress naturally and we\\'d fall in love, just like in the movies.\\n\\nShe broke up with her boyfriend, but like a little bitch, I decided not to go for it; I did not want to rock the boat. I was fully convinced that she was completely above me and that I was unworthy of her hand. \\n\\nThen she found another man a year later, when I was doing my Masters. She wanted me to host a party on NYE for her friends. As the only single person in the party, you could guess how that went.\\n\\nShe wasn\\'t too happy about my drunken outburst and we ended up getting into a couple verbal skirmishes, but we managed to work through it. I felt, and still feel genuinely remorseful for what I did. That said, we squashed it...\\n\\n... or so I thought.\\n\\nOne year later, she\\'s been getting into the whole social media, Tumblr-powered slacktivist thing. She was extremely overzealous about getting this one PUA deported, and I openly challenged her, saying that there was nothing wrong with the guy.\\n\\nRather than debate this like adults, like we usually do, she savaged me, calling me misogynistic and flinging other ad hominem attacks at me. We don\\'t talk for a month.\\n\\nStill deeply disturbed by this, I decided to try to reason with her again. This friendship was worth saving, and we could perhaps work out our differences one more time.\\n\\nWrong.\\n\\nShe continued to fling more personal attacks on my character. Like the Nice Guy I still was, I tolerated it, until she played an extremely sour note. As someone close to me, she said something about my mother, alluding to the fact that perhaps, *she* was the victim and not me. That was when I put my foot down and blocked her from my social networks.\\n\\nShe somehow managed to be shocked and decided to hit me up on WhatsApp a couple months later, giving me a non-apology, saying that her remark might have been more sensitive but that my kicking her out of my life was unjustified. I calmly told her that we were done, but she responded that I was being an angry immature, victim complex bitch.\\n\\nShe\\'s right. For the longest time, I have been angry, immature, and subject to a victim complex, the kind of victim complex that all neckbeard Nice Guys have. But no longer.\\n\\nAs of now, I haven\\'t gotten much action, but at the very least I\\'m extremely careful about who I let into my circle of friends. If a girl suggests that we should just be friends, she\\'s out. No ifs, ands, or buts. And I think it\\'s done me a lot of good. I\\'ve been hitting the gym since that whole debacle, and I\\'ve been feeling much better. I\\'ve learned to treat women like the simple, mortal human beings they are (as opposed to the enshrined demi-goddesses I thought they were) It\\'s a long road ahead, but I know that I will persevere.\\n\\nShe taught me something extremely valuable. Always respect yourself. Never bend over backwards for someone who is unwilling to do the same for you.\\n\\nAnd for chrissakes! If there\\'s a girl you like and she only wants to be your friend, don\\'t settle for that. Be brutally honest with yourself and the people around. You won\\'t win many friends that way, but you\\'ll win the right ones.\\n\\nThanks guys. I know it\\'s a little ranty, but from the bottom of my heart, thanks.',\n",

I always knew there was something odd about the female psyche, but TRP summed it all up for me. \\n\\nAnyways before TRP I was obsessing over my oneitis for this one girl that literally fed off my beta tendencies. I had no idea how to play this game; but my idealism for a perfect relationship kept me going. (I'm cringing as I write this) I used to dread at every little thing she would say. I had no knowledge of these concepts (eg: hamstering, dread, etc.) I was just utterly stupid and blinded with irrationality. \\n\\nSo in regards to my beta tendencies, here's a super cringeworthy example. \\n**Her**: Oh a lot of guys creep me and have tried to get with me..don't worry though :)\\n**me**: (panics)..asks her more questions. Thoughts of Chad Thundercock flood through my head fucking her in every possible way.\\n\\nShe got off on this and I didn't know how to stop it.\\n\\n***Post TRP***:\\nI stopped giving a fuck. It was so easy. I read the sidebar and it matched perfectly with everything she does. It was almost like I could predict her next move and I do. Went from being obsessed with her to plating her. From zero physical contact to making out, and I'm confident to progress next time I see her. (It's true that once a girl sees the beta in you, she can't take you seriously from that point) but my use for her is to enjoy the plating and I can say I definitely am. What's funny is ever since I've been applying TRP this bitch has the nerve to ask me to be official and I laugh it off. She knows we won't be official but she sticks around. (Before TRP, I would have agreed to get the pussy)\\n\\nPost TRP example:\\n**Her**: Hey I'm going to a party this friday\\n**me**: Have fun :) (no fucks given, not even giving a shit if she gets banged by 20 dudes, as long as I have my fun with her w/e)\\n**Her**: nvm I don't think I wanna be around drunk guys\\n**me**: you seem to be quite boring then :/\\n**Her**:says some generic shit about me being more important \\n\\nI simply stopped giving a fuck, it's the greatest feeling. I'm not writing this to boast myself. I have yet to fuck her. I'm still a beta bitch working his way to digest the pill. But, I wanna thank you guys and the community for bringing this change in my life. The unnecessary stress from women is gone. I need to get more plates and work towards being the best man I can be. Anyone can fucking do this and it will work.\",\n",

I've been reading TRP and Rollo's blog for a year, I knew the blue pill world was an illusion ages ago but I didn't know the exact details. Here is what I'm thankful for specifically:\\n\\n**Text game**: I fucking hate texting. TRP taught me women love the tension of late and short texts. Also, only text for logistics. Being in the wilderness and missing a couple of Facebook messages probably didn't hurt either. I set the whole thing up with only three texts to one of the girls and a post sex conversation with the other.\\n\\n**Abundance mentality/negative visualization**: When the girl I texted said she was unsure and had to think about it my old instinct would have been to offer a 1-on-1 fuck as an option if she wasn't up for a threesome. Knowing I had plenty of sex even if she declined helped stay silent to let her know it was a threesome or nothing.\\n\\n**Dominance**: Me being dominant in bed definitely made the whole thing very smooth, for both of them it was the first time they were sexual with another girl but they got caught up in my dominance and took turns helping me dominate each other.\",\n",

I told him \"I\\'m not paying for that, you don\\'t have the line cooks pay for every meal they mess up do you? You don\\'t have the bartenders pay for every free drink they give out do you? Why should I have to pay over an honest mistake too?.. This just raised his temper, and I admit I could\\'ve handled it more diplomatically than simply pointing out my employer\\'s faults.. But this resulted in me; **A loyal employee to this restaurant for 5 years** walking out the door in the middle of my shift. No (f)un-employment for me. \\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nToday, I hit up craigslist to find some day labor or some kind of temp work while I search for steady jobs. I have some experience with construction, landscaping, and other manual labor and got a call from this guy to help him out with some work on a construction site nearby. \\n\\n\\nI get to the site and introduce myself. They guy seems all right, he\\'s not very talkative but whatever. He yelled a lot of obscenities which is pretty common in these jobs and he was pretty hot headed. I honestly fucking hate working with people like this and it\\'s the reason why I don\\'t usually do this kind of work anymore, but I figured \"hey it\\'s just one day. I come here for 5 hours, get my $100 cash and leave.\" \\n\\n\\nAt one point, me and the contractor are moving a big piece of machinery up these really narrow basement steps; it\\'s a pain in the ass to say the least. The guy is getting really frustrated now and starting to take it out on me. He asks me to \"foot\" the machinery, which I had never heard of.. Then he starts calling me a fucking idiot, this and that, yelling really nasty stuff in my face. I told him to calm down or I was going to leave. We continue the frustrating job and he eventually pushes the machine in my direction (this is a 300lb box of steel on a relatively steep incline). I dropped the machine by accident and was fucking pissed. \\n\\n\\n**Now this angry contractor guy is coming at me about to hit me**. He got me in a headlock that I got out of, punched me in the mouth once, then I blocked a hit and gave him a right hook straight to his jaw. A few seconds later, the guy desperately needed to wash the blood off his face. \\n\\n\\nThe owner of the business comes out freaking out saying \"What\\'s going on?! Is there a problem?!\". The guy is pretty jacked and instinct kicked in. I had to get out of that place before the situation escalates exponentially. Who knows if the contractor has a gun, the business owner has a gun, or if both are gonna gang up on me. I calmly got myself together and started to walk out of the basement. Once I turned the corner, I started running. The contractor ran after me. I jumped in my car, wasn\\'t quick enough to lock the door and he opened it trying to drag me out. I floored it and luckily got away with my hide safe, and unscathed other than some minor bruising; however I had to clean the other guy\\'s blood off the handle of my car. I was nervous about police becoming involved, but luckily the security footage from the business where the job was captured the altercation and it would be revealed that I had no other option but to defend myself. \\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n**LESSONS LEARNED**\\n\\n\\n1.) Men get thrown off the job and shuffled out the door, and face a shitload of uncomfortable, harassing, and illegal work situations very often, and if we decide to quit or walk we\\'re shamed for not finding something new before we quit if we quit, being irresponsible, or lazy not matter how just our reasoning is.. Women facing these situations is **not misogyny** it\\'s the reality of \"being equal\" in the workplace. Some employers are fucking shitbags and only one step above a slave-driver and will go to great lengths to make sure their employees know that. \\n\\n\\n2.) Always stand up for yourself in work situations. Oftentimes, bosses will take out their lack of responsibility and lack of accountability for its poor operation on their workers. (If you ever watch Bar Rescue with Jon Taffer, you can regularly see him calling people out for shit like this.) Know how to stick up for yourself, and know what you\\'re getting paid for. Managers and bosses who belittle employees are losers.\\n\\n\\n3.) Men often face very dangerous and difficult situations that a lot of women don\\'t understand or can\\'t comprehend. Mainly because we\\'re always taught \"don\\'t be a little bitch\" \"suck it up\" \"keep it to yourself\". My own mother tried to shame me for walking off these jobs for not finding a new one and not sticking around to get the money I was to be compensated for the day gig. The solipsism is real. \\n\\n\\n\\nStay safe out there guys, when a situation gets violent always know that it has the possibility to exponentially escalate within a fraction of a second. This guy was a true psycho, don\\'t stick around to prove something.. If you have to get violent, do it as a means of escape. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I've always been a natural alpha - HS football star, college football star, big guy (6'2 240lbs), elite athlete, professional fighter, great parents especially my dad. I found TRP two years ago and have never posted but I've lurked HARD and feel it has genuinely contributed to my success as a person.  \\n\\nMaking this post today to say I appreciate that this information, a la The Truth, is being transmitted to the younger folk. The 16-25 year old boys who are wondering what they need to do to become men. That kid working in an office wondering what to do with his life. The whiny bitch boy that listens to his LTR's every command without question but wonders if there's more to life than being a dog with a nice sized dick. I'm glad there are people who don't succumb to the loud idiot's every demand. It seems as though today the losers - AKA the pathetic, fat, unambitious haters - are waiting for the **real men or women** to say something on a public platform (Twitter) just so they can get angry and try to take away the person's achievements using words like 'sexist', 'racist', etc.  \\n\\nThank you to those who post really intriguing articles and posts. To drop some names: IllimitableMan, Whisper, ShitsWithTheDoorOpen, RedPillDad, Heartiste... there are tons more. You get the idea.  \\n\\nI now have a public platform to voice my opinion (podcast) and it's been gaining some serious traction in the past few months. I am now making A LOT more from my podcast than I've ever made from fighting. Obviously I can't blatantly discuss The Red Pill on my podcast, but I absolutely drop subtleties here and there. Anyone with the proper frame of mind would have no trouble spotting them.  \\n\\nSo although you didn't build me up... thanks. Never stop. To you young dudes grinding it out - it gets better. I am now in my early 30s and reaping the benefits of the extreme hard work I've endured. Life is beautiful boys.  \\n\\nI'M OUT.\\n\\n\",\n",

Turns out she already started seeing another guy but \"wasn\\'t serious\". We would hang out and make out. Never had the opportunity to fuck her for logistic reasons but she said she wanted to fuck. I wasn\\'t comfortable with her seeing the other guy and wasn\\'t sure what to do.\\n\\nThe day after, I put my foot down. I told her that I won\\'t be in her life if she chooses to continue seeing this guy. She said she wanted to continue seeing him and was pissed at me for leaving her. She made her decision. I walk away from her.\\n\\nLater that same day I go to a comedy festival alone downtown because I had nothing to do. I see an attractive girl sitting alone. Ask her if she\\'s waiting for someone and if I can chill with her. She says sure. We spend 3 hours having a great time, she shows me around the place, talk about a lot of shit.\\n\\nShe has to go to an event with a friend but she said she\\'d text me after maybe we can go for drinks. Cool.\\n\\nShe texts me, I tell her lets go to so and so bar. She says she\\'s not down because she has to shower and change... so she invites me her to place instead to have wine.\\n\\nI get to her place, we chill in her bed, make out, and fuck for the whole night. It was literally the best sex of my entire life. She was telling me how attractive I was. Says she can\\'t sleep when she has a hottie in her bed. She must have went down on me 4 times (she initiated) plus I went through 4 condoms on top of that. We didn\\'t sleep. I never encountered a girl with such a high sex drive and so energetic in bed.\\n\\nBonus is that she\\'s not promiscuous. She\\'s 25 and slept with 8 guys in total, and none of them before the 3rd date. I\\'m the first guy she made an exception for.\\n\\nLesson: Go to the gym, don\\'t waste your energy on girls who you shouldn\\'t be wasting your energy on',\n",

Why do I feel this way?\"    \\n   \\nI\\'ve learnt so much from you guys. Archwinger and IllimitableMan were like the big brothers I never had. For once, with TRP, I was that 6 year old hanging out with the cool and suave 11 year olds; and they didn\\'t even MIND!    \\nThey taught me what I wish I had big brothers to teach me; and my little brother benefits from that by proxy.    \\n   \\nI\\'m still a virgin, and I still don\\'t have my own place or a job (I\\'m in school) but I am damn fucking sure all these things will change, and I\\'m in an awesome I-love-you-all-you\\'re-my-bros-and-I\\'d-die-for-you feeling towards so many of you guys. Thank you for doing what you do; this is the best part of altruism and this is why I can\\'t resist helping people either - seeing the smile on their face when they realise \"this is it; I\\'m the real deal, I\\'m legit, and I can handle the world\".    \\nDaaamn guys, thank you for helping me empower myself.

       "  'selftext': 'Discovered TRP as many others have after reading about how horrible it was in the opinion of neckbeards in a major subreddit somewhere. \\n\\n I was at a low point as my girlfriend of 1 year, my longest relationship  at 32 dumped my ass after about 6 weeks of things being sour.  I read the sidebar, lurked, opened myself up to that point of view but it took me about 6 months to start applying it.  \\n\\nI was in neckbeard shape, about 50+ lbs overweight between being lazy, eating shit and working swings and doubles and in the end was giving half assed dick.  It was my fault, though I\\'m more than happy she\\'s gone now.  \\n\\nWith a primal diet starting in Feb 2014 and beginning with one day a week of light, at home exercise, I worked my way to being a 4 time per week 2-3 hour gym rat.  15 years of damage don\\'t come off overnight but I\\'ve lost 35 lbs., have upgraded from neckbeard to a dad bod with nice arms and shoulders and the future looks very bright.\\n\\n  HB3-5s overtly smile and make fuck eyes with me at the gym and with the the stuff I\\'ve learned about frame, game and not letting people fuck with you, I\\'ve come a long, long way.  My boss asked me if I was on steroids, not because of aggression, just the rapid gain in appearance in the last four months.\\n\\nAnyways, the reason I\\'m writing this today.  Confidence rocks.  After a 15 hour day at the office, I stop next door for a beer.  A couple of gangbangers on my left, nobody to the right.  Sit, enjoy a tall Shandy and watch some baseball.  \\n\\nA blonde HB9 and her brunette HB8 friend come in and take over the bar.  They grab the empty seats next to me, pay me no mind as every guy in the bar comes up to \"pay tribute\". I ignore them and watch the Yankees-Angels game.  \\n\\nThe blonde after two minutes grabs my ashtray and passes it to the brunette while my smokes are prominently displayed.  A few months ago, I would have done nothing.  I confidently pull it back.  I then light a smoke.  The two girls do so ten seconds later.  \\n\\nI slide it over a bit and say \" It\\'s OK, my parents taught me to share.\". Have a little kino with the blonde while tipping our cigarettes and she jokes about how I can just get her hand out of the way by burning her arm.  Bartender fills my second and last round, grabs my check.  6 orbiters have been by in the past three minutes, fawning over them, buying them shots, etc.\\n\\n  The bartender is a total bro and one orbiter says to get the brunette whatever beer the blonde wants.  He says \"be specific, one of these beers is $42.\". I ask if it comes with a blowjob, the blonde hits me on the arm and says \" Yes, but from him(pointing to the guy who bought her a round).\"\\n\\nLeave on a high note.  We playfully started for another 3 minutes while I bary had my eyes on her, finished my drink, closed the tab.  She asked my name on the way out, I got hers and I said \"Maybe I\\'ll see you around sometime.\". \\n\\nAbout 12 men approached her, and a slightly smarter 6 or 7, her friend in that 20 minutes.  I had her attention by wanting to just watch a ballgame, enjoy my drink, but not be so much of a stiff not to be a good host to my seatmate.  \\n\\nIt\\'s a small city and I\\'ve never been to that bar.  Plant a small seed, maybe you can come back later and fuck that seed.  Regardless of the result, the pasty, still overweight guy set himself apart and I\\'ll never be blown out by a HB4 again.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Throw away account.\\n\\nGoing to try and make this one short. I'm a successful engineer working at a huge tech company on some major projects &amp; platforms (think multi-million dollars). Spent my entire 20's doing nothing but work work and working on tech related side projects, starting up a successful non-profit during that time. I've always been a good looking guy, but never really had luck w/ women, always drank the BP syrup assuming they would just come with time, didn't realize what it meant to be alpha.\\n\\nThere were a few exceptions to this, in my mid-twenties I went out with a 8/9 but made so many BP mistakes (realizing this now) that things never panned out. Not too long after I lost my virginity at 26 to an older woman (mid-30's) who contacted me through OKC. I didn't know it at the time she was going through a divorce, and technically still was married. In retrospect I'd rather not have done that and now to this day my hard rule is I don't go out with women in committed relationships. There are enough single women out there and I'm not going to betray other men by being dishonest and going behind people's backs.\\n\\nTowards the end of the decade I took up martial arts (Aikido) and focused on physical and mental fitness. For no other reason to be the best man I could be. My efforts paid off, I'm currently in the best shape of my life and am always eager to play sports and be active. I also spent a very long time studying and practicing various meditation techniques and jumped on opportunities to travel around the country and world for work.\\n\\nTurning 30 I started thinking about things differently. Partially due to the onset of health issues (spinal arthritis, acid reflux) I realized that if I was going to have intimate relationships with women in my life I needed to take a more proactive approach. For a while I was going out with another 8/9 but again made so many BP mistakes that I never sold the deal (did make it up to LMR! though didn't know what LMR was at the time). The girl disappeared not too long after that, and I went through a several month dry spell, putting myself out there, making plenty of mistakes, but continuing to learn from those. It was tough mentally as it was 5 years by this point since my last intimate encounter and the only time was when an older woman pursued me. During this period there were times I felt bouts of depression and questioned my efforts and ability to pursue women. I kept pushing forward, trying to get out of my comfort zone, and continuously learning from my mistakes.\\n\\nLast month I discovered TRP and everything clicked. The abundance mentality drove the final mannerisms which I needed to convey the man I am and what I am looking for in women. Last week I dated four girls (a brunette, a red head, a blonde, and an Indian girl) and last night I sealed the deal with the blonde.\\n\\nThank you TRP! There are no guarantees in life and this is just the beginning of another stage of self improvement but it feels great getting through a milestone! Am still insanely driven with work and always aim to do the best I can do there, but unlike my 20's I intend to spend alot of quality time in my 30's connecting with people in the real world!\",\n",

       "  'selftext': '*My apologies for the ensuing wall of text but I can\\'t thank The Red Pill enough for convincing me to finally begin thinking for myself.*\\n\\nI was introduced to TRP by a mutual friend while at the gym converting my anger and bitterness into progress - **I had been crushed**. I found the girl of my dreams and *knew* she was the Woman I wanted to settle down with for the rest of my life. I\\'ve never taken marriage or divorce lightly due to living through 4 of them throughout the first 12 years of my life. My Dad is on his 3rd (deadbedroom/bb) marriage and my Mother has divorced 3 men.\\n\\n*\"Divorce is a generational curse,\"* my Christian Mother and church taught me. It\\'s something spiritual that must be defeated by a diligent relationship with Christ and prudent search. \\nI grew up believing that God would bless my efforts if I never strayed from that - but NOWHERE did anyone teach me anything about Women. Noone taught me that Women will use and abuse a beta blue-pill provider until I was led to TRP. I\\'m of the Christian faith and now subscribe heavily to most everything TRP teaches. Many of my decisions after swallowing the pill differ from those of the Christian beliefs and I\\'m okay with that. Feminism has somehow snuck its way into the roots of my religion and would have you become as beta as possible in no time flat. \\n\\nSo what happened to my princess having said all this? **After her \"man\" lost his balls and got too comfortable, she dumped him very simply**. I lost all sense of manhood and leadership after a few months - as have many guys in FRs I\\'ve seen here. I felt as if I could let my guard down and she\\'d still \"accept me for me.\" **She taught me more than anyone else in my life up until this point**. She continually asked me to step up and be more outgoing - to take up for myself and her more. To spend less time with her and more time working on myself. She had begun to feel \"restless\" as if we were more of friends than lovers. Princess has some RP ideals from her upbringing but regardless is a party animal with a dark past. I\\'m happy to report that in 6 long months I\\'ve found myself and my backbone. I\\'ve lifted, dieted, and slept consistently for 4 of the months and am farther along in my fitness and appearance than ever before. I\\'ve learned the art of stoicicity and maintaining frame while developing game and ever increasing my SMV. I\\'ve gained my first plate - a former lesibian - and she can\\'t get enough of me\\n\\n**Thank you TRP for convicing me to take up for myself and be a Man**. IT WORKS and seeing in first person has blown my mind. I hope to be able to contribute to this community in the coming years.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I met this girl on Tinder. \\n\\nGirls on Tinder or any other social media will constantly get messages from beta blues, white knights, or other guys. You have to say something to make them validate themselves, or catch their attention. How often do they get “hey gorgeous” or a creative poem? Nice guys finish last, remember the mantra. Treat them as equals or less and grab their attention. So many people put them on pedestals. So if they’re blonde, “fuck you\\'re brunette.” If their brunette, “fuck you\\'re blonde.” Whatever it is. In this case, this girl, easily a 9, posted a picture with her dog. I messaged her about that. \"fuck. youre a fucking dog person.\" Within a few messages she was the one who gave me her number. \\n\\nI wait til the next day to message her. Nothing sexual or forward. She asks to hang out, I say I’m busy. It doesn’t matter if I’m busy or not, what matters is that I’m not making my time around her. Gorgeous girls always get mean her drool over them. Raise your SMV, be intentional and keep that hamster running.\\n\\nWe hang out the next night, go out. She tells me she isn’t going to fuck me that night.\\nHer actions said others, and it turns out she’s a liar. Remember, go after what they do not what they say. They have to convince themselves that no, they aren’t like that. They’re different. Think again. \\n\\nIt was fun. She was loud. She couldn’t make her sentences out, just like “oh. fuck. i. uh. i. oh my god.” It was really fun. She asked to stay the night, I tell her she can’t. She leaves.\\n\\nShe asked to hang out the next night, I tell her no.\\n\\nDoesn’t matter if I can or can’t, I tell her I have plans and am busy.\\n\\nThe next night I’m working and then am busy with some friends. I agree to hang out. I’m ignoring her texts but all day she’s sending me texts and snap chats of her wanting to hangout and excited about saturday night.\\n\\nNow, honestly this girl is a major babe. She’s gorgeous and stylish, and her personality is right up my alley. This is a girl I’d want to be with, but I can’t let her know that. Also, AWALT.  Super fun to hangout with though. Here’s where I felt like a badass.\\n\\nWe go out, and I agree to go to the bar with one of her friends thats a couple, one of her dude friends who I only agreed to hangout with if we wingman for him, get him a gal that night.\\n\\nSo we hangout with this dude, her couple friend is just infatuated with one another.\\nI’m sitting there next to her, she can’t get her hands off me, and I’m talking to her guy friend about girls and this guy is a total white knight beta blue pill. Such a “nice guy.” It was disgusting.\\n\\nI pull my date to the bar to get a drink, slap her ass on the way, she laughs and has fun. She mentions how her friend is such a nice guy. “Yeah, he’s insecure.”\\n\\n“Well. You’re just an asshole.”\\n\\n“Fuck you.”\\n\\n“That’s why I like you. You aren’t an asshole, you just know what you want.”\\n\\nI order a beer and get her a drink, I tell the bartender something with vodka and cranberry or fruity. They know what to make, the girl doesn’t even know what she’s drinking and honestly doesn’t care. She’s just refreshed a guy is taking decisions and being forward rather than treating her like a fucking princess.\\n\\nThe couple and beta blue friend leave, we hangout and makeout. Then go back to my place. She asks to stay the night. No. Hit it two times and I took her to her place.\\n\\nHas not stopped snapchatting or texting me, but I’m like barely replying. Except when I asked, “do you cook? of course you cook you can read cant you? Tomorrow night you\\'re going to cook for me and we’ll go ride bikes.”\\n\\nIt was fun. It was like the first time I’ve been this assertive and alpha in a situation and I’m pumped as shit about it. Thanks TRP',\n",

It really has done it's job with taking them off the pedestal and I love the playful banter between me and women now.  \\n\\nSo, thanks, and remind me to get some 9's and 10's in the future.  Haven't had any blondes yet, so thats my next goal.  \",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Thanks Red Pill, swallowing you has changed my life. \\n\\nAt the age of 18 I was moderately attractive, (good genetics but average aesthetics), Intelligent, good with guys, but terrible with the ladies. I would occasionally get one night stands when I went out. However no girls would date me, I didn't care, I told myself I wanted to be single.\\n\\nAge of 20 I go to Europe for a year and slept with over 30 different Women. Developed strong pick up bar game. Became a master of Drunk Hostel Sex.\\n\\nAge of 21 I fall in love for the 1st time, she initiates the relationship and also ended it. Left me in shatters.\\n\\n6 months later I fall in love again. Same thing happens, I wind up heart broken. \\n\\nI go into a 2 month self improvement phase. Increase SMV by going to gym, and improving my career path. All of a sudden I am getting IOIs from girls left, right and centre. However, I was still Blue Pill and couldn't lock down any female. I was desperate for a LTR because I thought if I met a nice girl I would be happy.... hahaha such a rookie beta.\\n\\nAfter weekends of getting girls numbers on nights out with mates, but still not getting any sexual results, I decided I needed to rethink my strategy. Discovery: The Red Pill!!! decided to commit 100%. \\n\\nWithin 2 days, 1st Plate, within 1 week 3 Plates, within 2 weeks 4 plates spinning 2 plates broken. I will commit to plate spinning for next few months, chemotherapy to cure my Blue Pill past. After that I might look at LTR, all I really want is regular sex with an attractive girl who doesn't bore me to death or disrespect me.\\n\\nWhat I have learnt, you can't just look for respect, you have to be someone worthy of respect.\\n\\nSwallowed the Pill, now I feel empowered.  \",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Long story short my wife decided to ask for a divorce a few months ago and it sucked to hear it. I thought she was the best thing I'd ever be capable of. Looking at it from an RP perspective I was wrong. \\n\\nI am now firmly seated in the third stage of TRP (bargaining). I am using a newly built confidence (and higher SMV than I've ever had) with women. I feel I have killed the beta, or at least the part of me that gave a fuck about me ex-wife. I had wondered why this happened so quickly, and all of a sudden it hit me. I had been going through the TRP digestion stages long before I knew what it was. \\n\\nThree years ago my wife cheated on me. This was only emotional as far as she told me. That was probably a lie, but that doesn't matter. What matters is how that changed my view of my wife and women in general. Because if my unicorn could do that to me then why would anyone else be different?  I got angry. Blood boiling angry. I would lie awake at night and tremble with rage. For the next 3 years whenever I thought about it I would get angry. This continued to damage my relationship with my wife. It was only after I found TRP. Only after I had done some reading that the anger subsided. \\n\\nNow in my mind I have moved on. Through interactions with other women I have developed enough of an attitude of abundance to stop caring about my 10 year long oneitis. \\n\\nI feel unaprehensive when talking to attractive girls. This is something that even a few months ago would not have been true. I have been able to build and maintain a frame for myself. I have a long way to go, but the positive changes I have been seeing continue to spur me forward. I see my divorce now not as a failure, but as an opportunity to become the man I always should have been. \",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I know I'm not actually really following Red Pill Principles in this scenario, but it came about from reading TRP and it's amazing how quickly it's made an impact. I'm 16, male, followed TRP stroll a few weeks ago in theory but in practice nothing happened. I am reevaluating it now and plan to use it for real, I feel some things are starting to get internalised already as I'm not worried what she thinks as there's plenty of fish in the sea.\\n     \\nI've always been ridiculous socially anxious around girls and have had none of that trouble around guys so it has caused me a lot of internal anguish over the last few years.     \\n     \\nBasically, I've been a bit of a uber-beta. Literally, the sort of beta you will never have seen before. To the extent that this girl literally told me that she would go to prom with me about 8 months ago and when I asked her on Sunday, she said she is already going with this dickhead (Not a chad thundercock, he's a complete pussy and everyone agrees, but he's a genuine dickhead. Like, not dark triad, just harsh insults for literally no reason). To emphasise how much of a dick he is:    \\n\\nLast year, he put in a shit cross in soccer. A guy jokingly said 'Nice across James ya dickhead!'. Jack then got all confrontational and threw a kick (Just because the guy was shorter than him, thought he stood a chance). The guy caught the kick and one shot to the face and he walked away literally crying. He then came back with teachers as he reported the incident.\\n\\nAnyway, it turns out she was waiting for me and thought I wouldn't ask so she decided to go with him instead. Old me would have given up there and felt really sorry for myself. I'm currently mid conversation and my moves to be working, she has admitted she doesn't want to go with him so it should be just a matter of time.\\n\\nShe's no unicorn by *any* means. Indian, nice and thin, no tits, no ass, probably 6/10 at a strong push. She's pretty socially awkward (very) which is my main issue as she may not have the guts to reject this current date now. However, it's the first girl I've spoken to in this sort of confidence to be honest and it's a huge step, and TRP always says to cherish the big steps for motivation. \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I just discovered TRP last year and have been actively working to incorporate some of the lessons other men have experienced, and now I’m on here today to share a recent experience of mine.\\n\\nI’m 44 and have been dating a single mom who’s 38. We agreed (and talked about this at length) that we would not see other people and that we were sexually exclusive. She agreed to this, and since we both work two jobs, there’s not a lot of time in our schedules for dating other people.\\n\\nWell, it turns out that I discovered that she is dating other people, but this time, as opposed to becoming emotionally compromised, I confronted her and asked her what is going on.\\n\\nShe told me “We’re sexually exclusive, but she still let’s men take her out to lunch and buy her stuff.”\\n\\nThe main reason for posting is to let other men know that time and time again, this is the norm of how women view men. There’s no animosity in this behavior, it’s just a matter of realizing that I’m just one of many resources she has at her disposal.\\n\\nNow, I only put this in here for anecdotal purposes, but I had convinced myself that all the mind-blowing sex we had every time we’ve been together would of tamed any of her branch-swinging habits. And again, it wasn’t her telling me it was the best she’s ever had, it was her multiple leg-shaking orgasms over the hours of marathon sex. I mean, if she’s being thoroughly sexually satisfied, that should be enough, right? Wrong.\\n\\nWomen are opportunist at any age and just because you can sexually fulfil a woman, has no bearing on how she views you. I have been pleased with myself on how I’ve handed dealing with this discovery--and I think it would have been in a completely different mindset if it wasn’t for TRP. \\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hi, Im 23(m) and I have lurked around TRP for a few months now, its great that Ive found a place where Im not so alone in my thinking, in fact so great that Ive decided to vent in here, yay for you. \\n\\nThis will be very offensive to humanity in general and Ill probably get banned but np Ive never vented before and dont plan on doing it again, just wanna see how it feels. \\n\\nThere is no TL;DR, fuck off.\\n\\n\\nLets start by saying all women are mentally controlled useless subhuman satanic filthy whores and all men who doubt this even 0.1% are the same. What is the difference between a used up tramp and an emotional tampon? NONE, you know why? Because the used up tramp is willingly letting herself be used and beat while the tampon is willingly devoting his life to a tramp that uses him and beats him. They are one and the same, this is why should never help betas because they are the whores that you would never commit to.\\n\\nI have been raised by one such tramp and here is my experience:\\n\\nMy first memory is an approaching wall and a feeling of danger and insecurity, I think I was 3 at the time, I was getting my hair pulled and head banged on the wall regularly for no real reason while my father watched like a massive faggot (imho just execute gays) who had to pretend like hes cool with it the same way bitch ass teens pretend theyre cool with being a jocks punching bag but he couldnt even lie to himself about it so from time to time he had to join in to convince himself its cool, welcome to reality.\\n\\nI was a very nice kid, non ragey, didnt ask for candy or made scenes at the supermarket like everyone does nowadays, fairly intelligent and very enthusiastic about life, all I wanted was to be left alone.. just fking stop beating me jesus christ that shit was brutal. When I would ask why Im being beat I could see the horror in their face as they were forced to come to the sudden conclusion that I did nothing wrong, then they would stutter and eventually tell me shit like \"you dont get to judge me i do what i want\", then they would let lose a fiendish grin as they realised there wasnt much I could do. I WAS HORRIFIED.\\n\\nThey would lock me in my room when guests were over, I did not understand why at the time (so that  the bruises dont show) as I thought this was normal and was \"adult time\".\\n\\nAs time went on, random beating wasnt enough anymore, they would create what I call \"the traps\". The traps revolved around them baiting me to do random things that they knew  I couldnt, when I failed they would constantly mock and ridicule me for the day, when I would succeed (adapt and overcome) I would be immediately removed from that area both mentally and physically in what could only be called an act of pure denial because abuse had become the norm to the point where anything non-abusive would force them to accept their subhuman nature, then  I would be beat again.\\n\\nAt about 7 years old the beatings intensified and had more shock value, they would come out of nowhere and when least expected and this time I would get my head stepped on and\\\\or random kicks or pushes sending me into pieces of furniture. I should mention that this is the only thing I had experienced up to this point so it was not yet as depraved as it sounds from my PoV, it was very confusing. \\n\\nI have received my first compliment in first grade, I did not know it at the time. The teacher there told me Im smart for solving some random math shit at the blackboard... immediately, I entered defensive state because in my mind she was trying to bait me into accepting Im smart so that she can then attack me (it was a matter of provide and then immediately take it away to create the illusion of loss). She was ofc just doing her job. Soon, more and more of these things started to happen and yet no attacks, I would slowly become aware of the contrast between the holocaust at home and everything else. \\n\\nBut then, crushed again. I went to the police and QQed that I was being beat, showed them the bruises, you know what the fatty (subhuman) policeman said? \"I dont need to help you, I get paid anyway\", they are heroes right? I then went to child protection services where a fatty hoe that was polishing her nails sent me on my merry way because she did not have time for little children (what the fuck?). My last attempt at seeking help was the school psychologist who ratted me out to my parents telling them to control their fking kid...such confidential, wow, evidently this was yet another woman. In hindsight these women were probably single and did not want to accept the fact that once you are a used up tramp, the good ones are taken, so I assume they did their whole \"lets hit men while theyre down because somebody else needs to pay for my mistakes even if this is just a kid and its my fking job not to\" thing.\\n\\nI was then sent on vacation at my grandmother from my father side, long story short, she put hot pepper on my tongue because I did not obey, when seeing her feeble attempt at pain does not work, she locked me in a bathroom (she had 2) with no light, food or water for 5h+. I would fall asleep in the darkness and wake up with the satanic hag hovering over me. \\n\\nAt this point I began to learn and somehow ralise in my mind what people want before they even look at me, I can always tell when they lie, I can always tell what they want, where they come from and most of the time what theyre thinking etc. Ive even been called a psychic and a magician by randoms (randoms= garbages who have not attacked me yet), ofc nothing magical about it just a lot of experience with flight or fight and self preservation + a  healthy does of paranoia. I dont know how to explain it properly but at the basic level its body language. If you see bullshit long enough , you eventually adapt. \\n\\n9 years old: I decide to fk it and run from home... I SWEAR TO GOD, the same fatty policeman that said he doesnt need to do shit brought me  home (was probably his area of work idk).... I was then held down by this piece of trash while my parents beat me and he flabbed like a fatty...GG humanity GG.\\n\\nThe epitome of the abuse was one day where I was stripped of my clothes because it was too hot outside, I then hid under the blanket of my bed while my whore took her clothes off, slipped into bed with me and started grinding on my 11 year old dick untill it got hard then she pretended that it was my fault and started hitting me....I just looked at her and told her \"you know you did this on purpose\", she then withdrew a little while shocked at the realisation that she cant really hide it for much longer.\\n\\n12-16: Hands burned at the stove, non stop bombard of mockery, ridicule and shaming for anything I liked\\\\did, intentional shaming to \"friends\" etc. Safe to say I learned to not be dependant on validation or emotional bonds... since I didnt receive any, EVER. People would slowly begin to treat me like an alpha now.. since apparently  the whore (both males and females) of babylon is turned on when you dont need her due to some random \"abuse me so I can pretend its gud because no balls to fight back so now if I learn to love it I can somehow win\" psychological complex that can only be described as a super mutated stockholm syndrome hamster.\\n\\nI actually got 1st place in one of my school years, I would skip classes a lot but when there were exams (tests) I would show up and quickly study in the breaks between classes and score fairly high on the tests, this served only to expose the subhumans even more.. since now they had become 100% garbage in my mind. They had to spend hours of studying at home while  I just waltzed in and took a nice long shit on their lives. My teachers hated me for being smarter than them and would constantly QQ at my parents every time they were wrong and I corrected them. \\n\\nAnd I would get beat again, but as always , every time, I would get up and say \"NUH-UH, Ill do it my way and you can beat me again\", they refused to understand that because they had not provided for me, they could not gain the respect a provider deserves therefore their opinions were considered garbage.\\n\\nCue in a lot of self education (kinda like being home schooled except I had to do it by stealth) and the fact that after 16+ I was too mature to be able to be beat again, guess what happened. No REALLY, GUESS...thats right, now the garbages would start to suck up to me and actually dared to elicit emotional responses.... I couldnt believe it, these fking  subhumans truly believed they deserved anything. Holy crap. NEEDY CLINGY DESPERATE SUBHUMAN SATANIC FAT WET USELESS FILTHY WHORES. Thank Jesus for saving them all, how sure are you he isnt satan?\\n\\nAfter observing everyone elses behaviour I can only conclude that 99.9% of the worlds population is simply supposed to be DEAD.\\n\\nIt is because of misguided alphas like einstein, tesla, leonardo, gallileo etc who have literally pimped the planet that the subhumans are allowed to survive. Should not have given them vaccines, should not educate the garbages, should not help them in ANY way. \\n\\nThe beta can never fking do it.. they just cant, you give a fatty a wife, money, a good job and decent status and he will still go out of his way to attack the children of whoever he perceives as alpha due to his deep psychological insecurities, when no more alphas, no more tech, no more medicine, no more anything =&gt; fatty dead, no ammount of money can buy skill =&gt; epitome of darwinism where even if you have children, you still kinda dont?\\n\\n\\nIn summary: Police went out of their way to help the abusers instead of me, social workers dont really do their jobs, teachers do not exist (only the student), the priests told me to forgive while holding my parents in high regards while the psychologist that is supposed to help will happily break confidentiality for a little bit of attention. \\n\\nNow the garbages that cant step on me anymore cuz  Im not a child are telling me that its my fault, that somehow I need to man up and be more social.. that somehow I am supposed to be their buddy. They just cant fucking accept the simple and real fact that THEY ARE NOT FUCKING WANTED.\\n\\nAll women are dumb used up beta whores, EVERY SINGLE LAST ONE, they all say the same thing, they all do the same thing. Even the feminist chief whore, that probably believes all men are pigs, she is FUCKING THOSE PIGS... pigfucking whore. \\n\\nTO THE FEMINISTS THAT ARE SECRETLY HOPING MEN WILL HIT ON THEM TO PROVE THEM WRONG SO THAT THEY CAN PRETEND THEY ARE A PRINCESS THAT NEEDED TO BE SAVED AND WAS NOT HAD BY 1 TRILLION DICKS : YOU ARE NOT WANTED YOU FUCKING WHORES.\\n\\nAll fatties are garbage, there is no such thing as \"we have personality\"... personality does matter the most (which is why hoes dont get to marry good men) but it does not mean they have it, they are all greedy insecure fat wet fish people that sweat from places they shouldnt be able to. They probably go IA IA CTHULHU FHTAGN before they chug down their McDonalds.\\n\\nTO THE FATTIES THAT BELIEVE THEY ARE HUMAN WHILE THEY BLATANTLY IGNORE THE FACT THAT THEIR BELLIES ARE TRYING TO LEAVE THEIR BODIES: YOU ARE NOT WANTED YOU FAT WET FUCK.\\n\\nAll religious men are subhuman, these hoes would gather in front of the popes place and actually wait for the old whore to show up and with a wave of his hand he makes them bow down to him, meanwhile if he were to use normal cloth and walk among them, they would not recognize him. Then they tell themselves \" Its not the cloth that makes the man, omagah thats so truuuu\". Their false idol then proceeds to tell them there is only one way to the father therefore everyone should believe in their own way. (WHAT THE FUCK ARE THESE PEOPLE EATING? DID THEY GROW UP NEXT TO CERNOBYL?)\\n\\nTO THE PRIESTS THAT BELIEVE FORGIVENESS IS KEY: GO DIE IN AN ARABIC COUNTRY AND FORGIVE THEM, YOU ARE NOT WANTED HERE YOU STUPID FUCK.\\n\\nEverybody else that thinks they are independent and somehow worth anything while blatantly ignoring the fact that you are needy and are doing everything you can for a slice of used pussy, KILL YOURSELF YOU STUPID FUCK, you are nowhere near alpha and you never will be. This is why Im fucking your whore wives with zero effort, all I have to do is ignore them and that in and of itself is enough to beat your shitty game because the contrast between  you and the absence of your subhuman presence is so big I dont even need to do anything to fuck your whore wives.  \\n\\nTO THE GUY AT THE GYM THAT PUMPED STEROIDS AND LIFTED 3 DAYS AND NOW WANTS TO TALK ABOUT HARD WORK: YOU ARE NOT WANTED, YOU ARE A FAKE, DIE.\\n\\nBTW, women want to fuck almost daily, if youre married and getting it  3 times\\\\month and you call it \"getting lucky with the missus\", IM FUCKING YOUR MISSUS.\\n\\nAlso all blondes are stupid, the only people who didnt think so are the people who brought us the holocaust.\\n\\nI have only one request, if you could all just breathe in deep and then just LET GO AND DIE JUST FUCKING DIE that would be great, ty.\\n\\nP.S. I have permanent brain scars , yay. Tell me more about how hard work will change me. Let me guess \"grow a brain moran?\"\\n\\n\\nAnd now for something completely constructive so that you may understand that there is truly no exception to AWALT, My mother was a virgin and my dad a military man, they married young and she was a princess and he was fairly alpha in the beginning and brought home decent cash, took her out, entertained well etc. They are now divorced and I am about to cut all ties with them, she is a whore that does not deserve a child while he is the subhuman that sold his child to a whore that left from him, now he has neither. Even the virgin is a whore:)\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you TRP for letting me vent, I am now completely disconnected from any form of neediness thanks to reading TRP and realising I am not the only one.',\n",

       "  'selftext': '**=Before: The Blue Pill=**\\n\\nI grew up in a fairly dysfunctional household where I had an estranged relationship with my father, and an unhealthy image of masculinity which was one part Homer Simpson, one part Hispanic machismo. As a result, I retreated into gaming and other introverted activities through most of my life. \\n\\nWhen I first moved for full-time work, I settled in, and tried the whole online dating thing, joining gaming groups on meetup, etc...and didn\\'t get anywhere. Basically, I was boring. The one most common for rejection with women: No Chemistry. For social groups: Doesn\\'t fit in.\\n\\n**=Give Me Some Red Pills, Doc=**\\n\\nI believe the turning point where I began to get my act together fast was about a year ago. I met a woman from the Balkans, and we started doing the whole \"date/hangout\" thing. She admitted she started dating another guy \"because I didn\\'t know if you were interested in me\" (read: had no spine). \"But let\\'s still spend time together!\" (Read: \"I want an orbiter\").\\n\\nI accepted. To her credit, she was relatively level-headed, and showed me AWALT. (\"I envy how guys can think about nothing. I think they\\'re superior\"), and did pay for meals on occasion (usual split-checks) but she was \"just friends.\" Eventually around December she cut off all contact. I made the mistake of becoming emotionally available and it cost me.\\n\\nThis was when I went on /r/TheRedPill. My previous exposure to \"RedPill\" was the normal mix of sites decrying it: RationalWiki, We Hunted The Mammoth, etc. So when I went through the handbook, I was fairly surprised at the lack of anger. If anything else, it felt more like an updated version of \"The Well-Cultured Anonymous\" (which I would recommend to a lesser degree).\\n\\nI had a very brief anger phase, simply because I was able to laugh the whole thing off. (\"Wait a second. She kept me on a tight leash, I got little out of it all, and she left once she was bored. Why am I upset again\") and from there I started applying myself again.\\n\\n**=Dance: Socially Acceptable Domination=**\\n\\nDance is a beautiful thing. I feel one of the great tragedies of our generation is how \"dance\" and \"club grinding\" are more synonymous than actual dance. \\n\\nI joined a contra dance community last year and it was one of the best decisions I\\'ve ever made. While not as good of a \"date dance\" compared to tango or swing (though I recommend both), it\\'s a good beginner dance, and the moment you join one dance community, you branch out and learn new dances.\\n\\nI\\'ve learned:\\n\\n* Abundance mentality: Simply surrounding yourself with multiple women means you don\\'t panic about each woman being the last you\\'ll meet. Generally, the women that do dance are in better shape than the ones that don\\'t, and tend more towards letting their guy take the lead. They want to be swept off their feet.\\n\\n* Command Presence: Contra works somewhat differently. You lead your partner. Across from you, you have another couple. Multiple groups of facing couples collectively form a line. Ideally, experienced dancers will pair up with new dancers, but occasionally you get couples where both are new...and you end up having to lead your group.\\n\\n* Kino: How to loosen up in a dance. How to handle women (shoulder blades or ribcage), and to make them an extension of you.\\n\\n* Posture: An amusing moment during my first night at swing dance was how the instructor spoke about proper composure, physical communication, and posturing was called \"maintaining frame.\" (\"Guys, you want to hold your frame.\")\\n\\nMy old attitude was: \"Most American women don\\'t dance. Learning to dance is pointless.\"\\n\\nMy new attitude became: \"Most American women don\\'t dance. I can make them do what I want!\"\\n\\nI recommend learning to dance. It\\'s done wonders for me.\\n\\n**=Women=**\\n\\nI no longer tolerate flakiness. In the past, I used to do the \"well maybe another time\" routine. Now, if a woman does the \"actually I can\\'t make\" without a good reason, that\\'s it. Radio silence. \\n\\nI have a plate/potential LTR (25/F). She\\'s a fashion girl, so she\\'s been invested in redoing out my wardrobe. Handling her been a major learning experience, as despite some earlier slip-ups, a mix of calm stoic and playful scoundrel, and her shit-tests collapse on themselves. I treat her halfway-affectionately, like a spoiled teenager trying to get a rise out of me and she\\'s eating it up. She wants me more than the other way around, and if it doesn\\'t work out? No worries, attractive women are a dime a dozen, and I have a good network of friends and interests to fall back on.\\n\\nLife is good. I feel in control of my life, I\\'m not ashamed or afraid to be a guy. TRP helped.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hello gentlemen!  So it\\'s Amazing how well this sub has helped me grow as a 23 year old man in college.  I\\'ve decided to contribute.  This was originally a throwaway account, but I\\'ve chosen to dedicate this account specifically to The Red Pill.  I named my account AmericanHistoryAFBB to make fun of the fact that this sub is often criticized for being a cult.  It\\'s not.  No Nazi\\'s here.  No feminazis either.  \\nToday I was the AMOG.  Recently, I\\'ve made a friend in the gym, Dima.  Dima and I often go to the park and smoke pot under the gazebo, a popular hang out spot for college and high school students, after our workout.  When we first claimed this spot as our new kick it spot, I ran into an old plate from November, Meggie.  For the past week or so she has been coming to hang out with us while we smoke.  Not only that, but one by one more people gather round and shoot the shit with each other; often people can be complete strangers and best friends by the time people start leaving.  \\nMost of these kids are 18 to 20, and I\\'m 23.  So I automatically have value.  I also have preselection and social proof.  So today, I AMOG the group to see how well people respond.  \\nI accuse them of being high schoolers to which they deny.  The girls tease saying I don\\'t like kids or something, to which I respond, \"Kids love me.\"  A good comeback to a very weak shit test.  \\nThe response I get from people is amazing now compared to before I took TRP.  Women are noticing me more than ever now.  It feels good to feel wanted.  I\\'ve had problems before, but TRP is helping.  Thanks.',\n",

Last year I got caught up in a mission organization overseas that had some cultish tendencies. I became a \\'victim\\' and let that be my identity for several months.\\n\\nI\\'ve been back in America since December. I started lifting heavy and just working hard, and by February my PTSD from what I saw overseas went away. And by the end of March I stopped missing my ex, who I had been caught up over (we broke up the August previous, because I was leaving America).\\n\\nRegardless, here is my thanks for the red pill.\\n\\nI WAS SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING MORE.\\n\\nMen in Texas, especially in the Baptist Church culture, are so fucking afraid to be men. They\\'re all beta passive blue pillers. There are some good men, but I had noticed (and I didn\\'t have the word for it, but I knew it in my bones) that the leaders of our church, small groups, etc, were just a bunch of BB passive men. I was searching for something more. Something tangible.\\n\\nSo. Someone brought up TRP in an INSULTING way on /r/askreddit.\\n\\nI checked it out. My roommate, a deacon, and an avid redditor, rolled his eyes. But in the last five weeks or so I\\'ve read several books that ya\\'ll re commended, currently I\\'m going through Models and the Rational Male after just finishing No More Mr Nice Guy.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen what I do for approval and affirmation\\n\\nHow I let other manipulate and control me\\n\\nFuck this. I\\'m moving to Oregon in two weeks. Starting over.\\n\\nFinally let go of victim mentality.\\n\\nI\\'m not drinking alcohol again until I get into the fire academy in portland.\\n\\nI\\'ve never had problems with girls, I\\'m a good looking dude and I\\'ve had tons of girls at my disposal, but I\\'m just over it. I was offered a threesome last week, and I didn\\'t even want it. Got a booty call two nights ago, said no.\\n\\nI\\'m rising above it.\\n\\nI don\\'t need some cheap sex fulfillment. \\n\\nI NEED to be a better man. Quit messing around with these petty illusions and imitations of life and suck it up. So I\\'m still working out, but I\\'m finally getting my life started again by trying my damnedest to go back to school for fire fighting, a man\\'s profession. I threw out everything I don\\'t use. I\\'ve been purging what I\\'mr reading and influencing to be positive and driving me towards the truth.\\n\\nMan\\n\\nThank you, TRP.\\n\\nPeople keep telling me I look so much better and happier. And I\\'ll attribute it to TRP and my decision to change internally, I was written up at work for calling someone out who was treating me like shit, but I didn\\'t back down. I have confronted my stepfather with how he speaks to me in passive aggression (me, 24), I\\'ve decided to go back to school, making the decision to finally move to the West Coast from the Midwest. \\n\\nWhat a time to be alive.\\n\\n\\nTo quote Alexander Supertramp in Jon Krakauer\\'s Into the Wild, \\n&gt;\"My body is weak but my spirit is soaring.\"\\n',\n",

Not only that but I did the most beta thing in the world and lost myself. Then I found the red pill. It had changed my life greatly and that is why I'm thanking you guys.\\n\\nIt's been a couple of months since I found the subreddit. Ever since then I have been reading, I have been operant conditioning myself to become a better version of myself. Today, that oneitis I was speaking about came out of blue and told me that she couldn't get rid off some feelings. You guys can't even imagine how big of a thing this was for me. Now let me be clear, even though I still do love her, I am not going to be with her. I am happy not only because my crush said these things but because I became the controller whereas I was the one being controlled before. What a great feeling that is, I can't describe.\\n\\nThank you all, that is all I can say. See you at gym!\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I want to start by saying that this is something I’ve wanted to write about for a while now and never really took the the time to do it. I’m a shit writer, so bear with me. I don’t think I’ve ever “swallowed” the red pill in the way that most people think of. I barely even talk to women anymore since it has become such a huge waste of my time and I’d rather focus on doing things for myself instead. Was I definitely blue pill before? Absolutely, but I have figured out a lot along the way.\\n\\nI had a girlfriend of 7 years that came crashing to an end, and I should have seen the writing on the wall. I was kind of in denial back then about my circumstances. We loved each other I thought. We were young, each other’s first for everything, and practically inseparable even though we didn’t live together. I took things for granted and thought that she would always be there. I thought that she was the one, that she was different, and that I would never lose her. When we broke up I felt blindsided, but looking back all the typical signs were there. She broke up with me for a guy she worked with, and in all likelihood was seeing him on the side before she broke things off. This is when I learned that AWALT.\\n\\nI tried dating a few other girls but none compared to her. After 7 years of being with her I still had oneitis. It took longer than I care to admit to shake her from my mind on a regular basis. If it weren’t for my best friend (who is RP through and through) I may have never shook that funk off of me. He made me dress up, he made me go out, he made me talk to girls, and he made me make no excuses. “Well I’m tired, I really don’t want to go.” “Tough shit, get dressed. We’re leaving in 30 minutes.” I managed to meet a few girls online who were slumpbusters for me. It helped boost my confidence that if I didn’t have to try with these average girls; imagine what I could do if I did try for the hotter ones. I casually dated girls for the next couple of years and got into the mindset of “If I’m just casually dating, who says it has to be with just one girl at a time.” After about two years of trying to build myself up and present myself a certain way, things started clicking together. I was spinning plates, but I started small. With two plates I felt awesome and I got greedy. I started talking to more girls and got to the point I was spinning four plates and it really took a toll on me (kudos to you guys that can do that). This was definitely a high point for me until I couldn’t spin all the plates anymore. I tried my hardest to keep things the way they were going but good things don’t last forever. These girls started to realize after a few months that I had no intention in committing to them, and one by one they were gone. I was tired of it anyway so I decided to just go at it a day at a time.\\n\\nAs new girls came into my life I still tried to be that nice guy in a way, but I knew that I had to hold frame. When things got rocky I stood my ground, and I never backed down. The last girl I went full asshole with. I was to the point I didn’t care about making anyone happy anymore; I was in it for ME. I became cocky, and quite literally did not care what she thought of me. We’d hang out and meet at the bar, or talk on the phone and I was rude and didn’t care. I figured if nice guys finish last, I’m going to come in first for once. I pushed that persona to the edge with total disregard for what happened next. She even said to me “You’re rude, and talk down to me. I have no idea why but I can’t help it that it makes me want you more.” She got the tingles. We fooled around for a while but she insisted that we weren’t going to have sex. I didn’t care either way, because she still came over and she still gave me blowjobs. Sex has never been a priority to me, and to be honest it just doesn’t feel right unless I’m severely attracted to someone. I don’t feel that it’s any good unless I really connect with that person. I wanted her to stick around and she didn’t want the same even though we started getting along great. Everyone thought we’d end up together very soon and we didn’t. She gave me the line of “I really want to be your friend and want you in my life, but I can’t be with anyone right now.” My response was “I only have room for you in my life if you are with me, I have plenty of friends and I don’t need any more.” Basically, I did not have room in my life for her if she didn’t want to be a part of it the way I wanted her to be. Then I went radio silent, no contact. Shortly thereafter I moved across country to start over and get away from the shit hole town I lived in. When I look back it’s because I caught feelings, and tried to slip back into the good guy slot again. This failed miserably and made me realize that I can’t ever be that guy again. It just doesn’t work.\\n\\nA few months later I stumbled across TRP and having been lurking hard ever since. I don’t see much of what I have accomplished as a victory but knew I was on the right path once I started reading the posts here. I had the right idea, but didn’t have the coaching. As I started to learn about the concepts of RP, I can look back and see where I have applied certain principles and that they have worked very successfully. It also helped me realize where my mistakes were and how to correct them. There is so much more I could write about with personal experiences, but I suppose I could save those for another day. TRP has opened my eyes a little bit wider, and made me think on a much more critical and logical level. Thanks TRP for being the kick in the ass that I needed. I am 100% confident that I am ready for the next person I decide to let into my life.\\n\\n(I originally posted this to TRP, and realized it was better placed here.)',\n",

AWALT &amp; the almighty hamster (All my exGF, My Mother and my Sister)\\n2. Frame. Define and spell out what you want when interacting with a female mate. \\n3. Concept of SMV. Yours. \"Hers\". My take-away: Reflect if you want to keep trading in time you can spend on yourself for developing plates / leads \\nfor intercourse/intimacy/sex - and how much that time is worth - for you. \\n4. Don´t be betabux - My take-away: I told a suitable woman, mother of 2 who looked me up and semi-stalks me, now in the middle of her divorce that I will never step in to be \\na \"new dad\" -(TRP core tenet) - and I framed our communication successfully - and am not looking to seduce her - what she knows and takes into account\\n5. \"Nice guy syndrom\"  - it´s real - nobody besides TRP told me - there´s a book to unlearn unhealthy behaviour patterns - which is what I am doing.\\nIf you reacted passive-agressively in the past, or held back with expressing what is important to you - look into these patterns - the symptome also can relate\\nto your father or even females that you know - learn how to handle it or how to counter it. \\n6. Alpha vs Beta - for some it´s a world view - for some an ideology - for others it´s purely situational awareness\\nThere is a thing as a \"relative beta\"  - the wing-man falling into his own sword. IMHO alpha &amp; beta are the most misunderstood &amp; ambiguous concepts within TRP\\n7. You are either the orbiter to a person  - or the person is the orbiter to you - or (3rdly): there is a non-reaction-situation between the both of you-\\nYou have to decide how you want to (see 2.) frame the relationship. View of TRP: Never be the orbiter, it does not pay off.\\n8. With a a heavy dose from MGTOW - always seek to improve yourselves as a goal in and on itself - don´t seek approval by others. Don´t court women - put yourself in a position where they court\\nyou. Use the concept of SMV (yours/hers) to decide if you you want to spend your time with her.\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I\\'m what you\\'d classify as a sensitive guy. I\\'m not a manly man, I don\\'t like sports, I\\'m not interested in non-committal sex. I\\'m in tune with my feelings and emotions, as gay as that sounds, and I express myself often. Unfortunately, expressing our emotions seems to be widely discouraged by everyone. \\n\\nAnyways, for two years I was dating a girl and things were going great. She then announced that she wanted to become a stripper. \\n\\nNow as an aside, I believe that cheating is defined by the parties in a relationship; what one person considers cheating, may not be cheating to someone else. And I believe that when you enter a relationship with someone, you should respect their boundaries and respect their definitions for cheating. That\\'s fair right? \\n\\nSo I expressed to reddit that I felt that her stripping for other men was cheating, it fell well within my definition of cheating. I\\'m a monogamous guy and a bit spiritual, so I made it clear that being a stripper was out of the question. \\n\\nMost of reddit attacked me like I was an asshole for feeling uncomfortable with that and defining it as cheating. Most of reddit, except you guys. \\n\\nEveryone always said TRP are assholes. They are sleazy women-haters. But when I was experiencing a crisis, it was TRP that were supporting me. You guys were the most understanding, kind and supportive people in the group. You guys made it clear that A: my emotions were just as valid as hers, B: It\\'s perfectly ok for me to not be comfortable with what she was doing and C: it\\'s not acceptable for her to callously disregard my feelings and concerns. \\n\\nI broke up with that girl shortly after for unrelated shit (we had a different vision for what the future should look like), but afterwards I came here and observed. \\n\\nIt happens where sexism will crop up here. I won\\'t deny that. But ultimately, this subreddit and it\\'s related ones are all about male empowerment. It\\'s about showing men that they don\\'t have to cater to everyone else. Just like how feminism teaches women to be strong and independent, TRP teaches men the same thing. \\n\\nBe strong. Be independent. Don\\'t answer to anybody but yourself. Live smart, think critically, and don\\'t let horniness and manipulation cloud you judgement. Don\\'t let people treat you like a doormat. \\n\\nThis sub teaches men to have courage and take control of their own destiny. \\n\\nI still believe in love, I\\'m still a hopeless romantic. But I also know that I don\\'t have to compromise who I am as a person, or degrade myself morally and emotionally. And I owe that to you guys. \\n\\nAnd hey, I met a sweet young lady who\\'s not a stripper and doesn\\'t feel the need to belittle me for my feelings and morals. I probably owe that to what I learned from you guys too, so yeah. \\n\\nReally though, I just wanted to thank you guys for having the balls to stand up and protect manhood and for encouraging other men to be better. You guys are awesome. I don\\'t have to even say \"keep it up\" or \"don\\'t let the haters get you down\" because I know you don\\'t need it. You are strong, uncompromising men, and like men, you will get shit done.  ',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'My post doesn\\'t really have to do with dating or relationships, which was the primary reason for myself (and most posters) coming to TRP in the first place. I took the logic of the red pill and applied it to other facets of my personal life (school, work, chores, family etc..) and it has helped tremendously.\\n\\n\\nBefore I found TRP I was an out of shape, lazy slob. My bedroom was a mess constantly, I only did what was considered the \"bare minimum\" to get by when it came to work, school, personal relationships etc.. My girlfriend had just dumped me for an \"alpha\" as well. \\n\\n\\nI was rock bottom. Shitty job, living with my mom, dropped out of school, I was a loser. This place gave me strength. TRP gave me the courage I so desperately needed to muster up within myself in order to shine. \\n\\n\\nI re-enrolled in college, got straight A\\'s for two semesters straight. I got back on my game and currently have 2 plates that I am banging, although it\\'s not as frequent as I like (mainly due to being busy with work and school) but it\\'s something! \\n\\n\\nMost importantly I decided to stop holding back from my learning. I always used to put off university to hangout with my friends. They\\'re not really bad guys, but we don\\'t have the same goals in common. I stopped hanging out with them as much and focused more on my studies and meeting with classmates to work on projects together or study. I have learned to LOVE what I do and love the process with academia. \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s so funny to think that this all began when my last girlfriend dumped me. She was my \"one that got away\" how funny it is that such blessings are so cleverly disguised. I was at rock-bottom and when I found TRP I realized \"She left me for him because I\\'m a loser and he\\'s a winner\". I felt victimized at first, then I felt ashamed of myself and hated who I was, then I said \"I\\'m going to grow and become 10x better than her or that new guy she met.\" \\n\\n\\nI started hitting the gym HARD. I\\'m talking 10 hour work day (cooking in a restaurant) followed by a 3 mile run and 1 hour of lifting. I felt like a rabid animal and it was great. \\n\\n\\nAny day that I felt the slightest tendencies to slack at the gym, I just thought about my ex. I thought about that new guy she was with, and how I wanted to beat the living fuck out of him (I know that\\'s going far, but it was a knee jerk emotional reaction). I thought about all of those times where I didn\\'t feel strong enough to defend my friends during an altercation that could potentially turn physical. I thought about my ancient ancestors how only 300 of them faced an entire army, and still charged into battle, swords and spears raised, looking death straight in the eyes and knowing their ultimate fate, and I LIFTED. \\n\\n\\nThis experience of exercising like a maniac chiseled my mindset a bit and I adopted the philosophy that; If I\\'m not dead or passed out, I\\'m still capable. This eventually evolved into the mindset that \"feels\" make you weak. It\\'s okay to have feelings about stuff, and to get upset or bummed out about occurrences in life, but to let those experiences define YOU is weakness. Take a loss. Tom Brady can take a loss, and Michael Jordan can take a loss. If you want to be a champion you must learn to fail with dignity. \\n\\n\\nFast forward to today; working 40 hours a week and enrolled in 6 college courses. I am averaging nothing lower than an A- in all of my classes because I love the process. Just as a body builder gets amped on lifting more weight, I would get amped on doing STELLAR work. I don\\'t get moody because a girl didn\\'t text me back, I just forget about it all together or don\\'t think too much about it because I have more important things to worry about than some chick\\'s approval. \\n\\n\\nThis spring, I will be earning my associate\\'s degree. I was just accepted to my #1 choice for colleges (one of the top schools in the world for my chosen field) AND they\\'re giving me a $12k scholarship on top of that. It\\'s so funny and a little absurd to think that this two year journey was sparked by being bitter and butt hurt over some townie chick who dumped me for some guy that plays an acoustic guitar to 10 people at a bar and sells pot out of his dad\\'s garage.\\n\\nAWALT was the best thing that ever happened to me. \\n\\nAF/BB was the best thing that ever happened to me. \\n\\nGETTING DUMPED BY THE ONLY WOMAN WHO I EVER LOVED WAS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.',\n",

Awkward but sociable until college.\\n\\nI didn\\'t really need help with women, though learning the why and how helps, but what TRP really did for me was to unlock the man inside that should have been allowed to grow from the start.\\n\\nSomething felt intuitively wrong every time I supplicated to women or \"checked my privilege\" or apologized for my sex even though I, as an individual, had done nothing wrong. As a \"feminist\" in my college years (even stating it turns my stomach), there was always this little circuit in my mind, firing whenever I defied my inner code, a code that wasn\\'t opened until I digested a series of red pills.\\n\\nI come from a family where one side was hot-blooded Italian and combined with Irish rogue, and the other a strong, German heritage. My father and the grandfathers on both sides were sailors that traveled world. They had all fought in various wars, from WW2 to Vietnam, and had all retired to become craftsmen (3/4 carpenters), farmers and mechanics.\\n\\nThen, their heritage came down to me. In my childhood, their genetic will for me to become masculine, as natural as it had come to them, was imprisoned behind 90\\'s feminism and political correctness. I was not allowed to grow naturally as all my fathers had before because that was \"machismo\", or some other nonsense.\\n\\nNow, after TRP, I feel as if a weight has come off me. I talk and act and tease and work and fuck in a state of natural equilibrium, as if these actions were the manifestations of my true inner self, rather than the result of an artificial, PC script.\\n\\nTRP, in my belief, is not a way to turn males into real men, but to lift the barriers that keep men from being real men.\\n\\nSo thank you, TRP, for allowing me to be the man that I was supposed to be.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Long time lurker, posting here under another account that I made for TRP...been in the game for almost 8 years now. I was in a 4 year relationship with a girl we\\'ll call \"Beth\". We met in university, graduated the same class. It was kind of an interesting relationship. We started out as friends with benefits, we fucked for over a year and it was kind of a messed up situation. She found out I was fucking another girl and got pissed, she wanted a real relationship, and I agreed.\\n\\nI knew pick-up and how to pick-up chicks, but I didn\\'t know relationships well, or I just assumed the same rules apply, which I now know is totally not the case. I could tell that Beth enjoyed sex and liked to fuck. I\\'ll admit, she did a good job seducing me into a relationship.\\n\\nMy first red-pill moment was when her best friend and roommate \"Jenn\" at the time was going out with a guy from my home state. He was working 3 weeks at a time in the oilfields and in her \"treated her very well, like a queen\". He did whatever was asked of him, bought her nice things, it seemed like any girl would kill to have a guy like him. However, there were problems that came up, they barely had sex and he couldn\\'t get her out of the house to do activities. What sharp contrast to when they first met. They would go out camping, drinking, skiing together all the time, but when they moved to her home state, she just turned reclusive. It was night and day. Sure enough, she ended up cheating on him, with a co-worker, this went on for awhile (more on it later). The strange thing is, not one of her female friends stood up and defended him, or let it be known to him, they just stood there in silence and acted like nothing happened. Looking back on it, I should have taken a closer examination of my relationship with Beth, and I wish I told him about what happened because he didn\\'t deserve it. I didn\\'t pay much attention because Beth disowned her as a friend shortly after so I thought all was well and I had nothing to worry about.\\n\\nFunny enough, my second red pill moment was involving the same girl. This time she was cheating on her new man \"Dave\" with a guy she used to fuck back in the day. I\\'ll never forget it. I even told Beth \"If my gf went to two weddings in two weekends without me, I would think something is up\". The key I learned here is that girls who constantly branch swing are no good anyway. They\\'ll cheat on their original bf, they\\'ll shack up together in 6-9 months, get sick of him, and find another man or go back to their and fuck, and repeat. They\\'re just miserable in their life.\\n\\n\\nMy third moment before discovering the red pill was during which a time my relationship wasn\\'t going so well with Beth. I got sexually frustrated and felt the relationship was going nowhere so I started looking for validation outside the relationship. And there I met Lorraine, works in the same job as me, a year above me in the MBA class. I wasn\\'t expecting sex and I was stupid enough to think things would get better. Next thing you know myself and Lorraine are fucking...man did she ever have really hot moans. What she didn\\'t tell me was she had a bf going on for 8 years. In fact, they are still together and engaged. Poor guy. This was another guy who treated her really well, took her on trips like Ireland, Europe, Jamaica, etc. I don\\'t think he had a sweet clue that his gf of 8 years was sleeping around on him. Funny enough they are engaged and intend on marrying this fall. Do you think she\\'s gonna stop? I doubt it.\\n\\n\\nI broke up with Beth almost a year ago, but it took me a long time to digest and properly articulate everything that happened. The sad part? I remember a couple of times I tried just to even fucking compliment my now ex-gf and she was insulted because I \"was just trying to make her feel good\". Why? She liked being complimented by perfect strangers because \"they had no incentive to lie\"...even though she lied to me a lot about sex, and sexual activities. How fucked is that? You value some random loser chode\\'s opinion over your fucking boyfriend of 4 years! I now realize it\\'s because of her insecurity. I actually feel sorry for her. Ever since we broke up, she has dated losers with a combined 26 page long rapsheet, now smokes, does drugs and has gained weight. Not only that, when her relationships get rough she cheats on him with another guy before breaking up with him because she\\'s too insecure to be alone. I feel bad for them just as much as I do for her.\\n\\n\\nI feel much more enlightened and have a better understanding what is going on and hope to apply it to my next relationship. Thank you for making me a better person, TRP.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"In reading the embarrassing 'field reports', the complete inability to understand experimental design and statistics, the hamstering, the bold championing of manipulation tactics, and the descriptions of successful 'red pill relationships', I have come to value the relationship that I have with my SO even more than I would have otherwise. Gawking at the horrors that can be encountered in the dating pool can really make someone cherish the fact that they will never have to take a dip. It feels great to know that I have formed a relationship built on a foundation of mutual respect and trust with somebody who is intelligent, affectionate, humorous, and secure in himself to the point where he doesn't need to resort to 'maintaining frame' to avoid showing his feelings. Reading /r/theredpill has illustrated that thousands of single men believe that 'game' is the solution to relationship problems instead of genuine, mutual communication, and that there are actually people who believe that relationships are a zero-sum game where only one winner emerges. A handful of academic fields investigate instances where things go wrong in order to figure out what occurs where things go right, and /r/theredpill is a fantastic tool in this regard. Not only can it make people in healthy, loving relationships grateful for what they have, but it can also allow onlookers to identify when they unknowingly use harmful communication tactics advocated by /r/theredpill. As such, I am very thankful for the sub.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I, as a nofapper have begun to discover the merits of TRP and wanted to show my appreciation.\\n\\n\\nThanks for the feedback regarding the [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2wtttu/23m_95_days_hard_mode_quarter_life_crisis/) guys.\\n\\n\\nLong story short, I was being bitch.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: I was invited to a dance by someone who did not intend for me to be her date. Was initially embarrassed but danced and had a good time anyway.\\n\\n\\nHere is how it went down:\\n\\n\\nGirl xyz asked me to attend dance hosted by her sorority. (I accepted).\\n\\n\\nI thought she was interested in me.\\n\\n\\nI called her a week later and said I was interested in her. (She said the feeling was not mutual).\\n\\n\\nThis turned out to be moot because she began dating another of my friends a few days later. (He is a cool dude, I have no problem with this).\\n\\n\\n\\nFast forward to the dance:\\n\\n\\nGirl xyz texts me to ask if I still wanted to go. (I\\'m over the whole thing and just want a night out). I reply \"yes\".\\n\\n\\nI show up on time.... She is not there. I know nobody. Everyone asks who my date is after I introduce myself. I say its girl xyz. I\\'ve made it a point to be unperturbed by these things so I mingled anyway.\\n\\n\\nGirl xyz shows up an hour and a half late with her boyfriend. This just got super awkward for me. I was not told I\\'d be going solo. (Shame and fear begin to wash over me).\\n\\n\\nThere was to be sessions of \"ballroom\" dancing so I\\'d need a partner.\\n\\n\\nI had the urge to leave but my commitment to maintain my IDGAF nerves was resolute. I showed up to dance and I was not to be denied.\\n\\n\\nI asked the nearest unmatched girl shorter than me to dance (I can\\'t spin a girl taller than me). She says she is a lesbian and begins making out with a butch girl in a pant-suit... I was convinced... I then walked over to the corner of not-so-cute girls without dates. I picked one out and said \"you are dancing with me.\"\\n\\n\\nI danced my ass off with this chick for the next 2.5 hours. She was talkative and seemed into me. I wasn\\'t into her and didn\\'t try to get a number.\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\n\\nI know I can handle awkward.\\n\\n\\nI will never associate with girl xyz again.\\n\\n\\nI exercised my right to be the selector and not the selected.\\n\\n\\nA few months ago, I would have gone home after girl xyz showed up with her boyfriend and felt sorry for myself.\\n\\n\\nThat is not me anymore.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'A bit of background to give you guys an idea of my journey down the rabbit hole so far. \\n\\nThroughout high school I was a beta, without question. I was the guy who girls came to with their boyfriend/relationship problems, and I got some kind of validation out of this (fucking stupid). However, towards my senior year I started to develop more and more Alpha qualities. I had been lifting with my dad (incredibly strong dude for his age) 5x/week and wrestling 3x/week at an intense summer wrestling club. By the time senior year hit, I was ready to fuck the world for 72 hours (shoutout Kendrick). Immediately, I started spinning plates without even knowing what that meant as I hadn\\'t discovered TRP up until a few months ago. 3 different bitches from 2 different grade levels, 2 of which had boyfriends. Fucked 2 of them, other one was a bit of a prude and I hadn\\'t properly developed my game. \\n\\nThis is where it all came crashing down and I was reverted back to being a beta bitch. \\n\\nWhile spinning my plates, I fell hard for the one who had a boyfriend she was on and off with. We were \"dating\" for a while, then we made it official about 3 months in after constant \"breaks\" because \"she still had feelings for the other guy\" and \"she knew what it felt like to have your heart broken and didn\\'t want me to experience that.\" AKA she was fucking that guy and one other. Of course, the beta in me took her back every time. \\n\\nAfter those tough 3 months, shit went really well for about a year, then I caught her sneaking around with one of her other exes through Facebook and text messaging. I even caught her parked at his fucking house. But yet, I still took her back because I had developed one of the most serious cases of oneitis the world has ever witnessed. I was trapped. \\n\\nFinally, after about 2 years of this, we didn\\'t get back together after I caught her doing the same shit she had been pulling for the past 2 years. \\n\\nFast forward another year, and here I am, writing this post. I have realized how shitty my life is because of my own actions and beliefs about women. I destroyed my self-confidence, I turned to drugs and alcohol to ease the pain of losing her, stopped working out, stopped socializing, completely lost my identity as a man by only identifying myself as my relationship with her, basically fucking destroyed my life. \\n\\nBut now, I\\'m awake. I have seen the toxic lifestyle I\\'ve allowed myself to live for the past 3 years. Today marks the day where I officially have killed my old self. I refuse to be a fucking beta bitch and let people walk all over me any longer. \\n\\n\\nI started lifting again and have been seeing great gains so far.\\nI\\'ve got 1 and a half semesters left of uni, one of which being an internship at a law firm. \\n\\nI\\'ve started learning Chinese with a goal of moving to China for 2 years via the Peace Corps to teach English. \\n\\nI\\'ve got a goal to go to law school after my time in the Peace Corps. \\n\\nTRP talks so much about Game and how to deal with women, but for me it\\'s much bigger than that. This is a lifestyle I truly want to commit to and utilize it to achieve great things. The most valuable thing that TRP has taught me is that no one, not even your own fucking parents want to see you hit the pinnacle of success. Every single day I\\'m ridiculed for believing that I can make something great out of my life. \"Stop being unrealistic\" \"It\\'ll never happen\" \"You know how slim the chances are, don\\'t you?\" \"You\\'re doing WHAT?!\" \"Good luck with that!\"\\n\\nFuck. All. That. What\\'s the point in living if you\\'re not going to give it every ounce of strength and willpower that you\\'ve got? The answer for me is simple: there is none. I\\'d rather die a warrior than live as a coward. \\n\\nI just want to thank TRP community for getting my ass in gear and helping me to realize that everything you do in this life is a result of your own doing, and no one is here to help you fix your fuck-ups. Never, ever again will I let a woman rob me of my precious time in this life because of my ideals about what love is supposed to be. I\\'ve swallowed the red pill, and I have no intention of turning back now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Discovered the red pill about 10 months ago in some random thread bashing it down. I think a good 90+% of us learn of the red pill this way. I was made aware of the red pill however I didn\\'t read into it, I just trusted the previous thread bashings that you were all msyognists and creepy rapey PUAs.\\n\\nFor a good two months I was subscribed to the blue pill. It\\'s funny how posts can actually seem cringey if you haven\\'t read the sidebar material.\\n\\nSo after highschool wrapped up I found myself bored and lonely. I had never kissed/hugged a girl let alone sleep with one. At the time I couldn\\'t even visualise how I\\'ld even get to that point. No friends at all, literally no text sending about anything but study-related shit with group assignment partners. I felt like I was destined to be forever alone and felt like I should go travel the world as a last resort to find something worth living for (which I still intend to do but no longer as a last resort method).\\n\\nSo I decided to read up on the red pill theory in a state of boredom mixed with desperation. I also wanted to read up on other controversial theories like Scientology and feminism. Fuck that shit, from the moment I started reading that sidebar content I was hooked. It all fucking made sense within a day\\'s reading. I became obsessed with the red pill, writing down and memorising key concepts and checking TRP every day. Started lifting HARD. From 2 jogs a week to 5 jogs and 5 hour long gym sessions a week. To this day I still lurk TRP at least once a day (usually three times). I gorge down every fucking thread I can and absorb what knowledge I deem useful, so if you ever post in the red pill you can bet your ass I\\'ll be reading it.\\n\\nI\\'ve never felt the need to up vote or down vote anything and I rarely post simply because I don\\'t feel experienced enough yet, one day I\\'ld like to post on the front page.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo college begins and I put everything I learnt into practice. AMOGing my way through every lecture and tutorial and meeting as many people as I can, with undeniable confidence and rapport.\\nNever fucking underestimate body language, eye contact and the tone of your voice. I guess my height and lifting helps too. Everyone just seems to like me and want to hear my input. Once you get a taste of AMOG in large groups there\\'s no going back. I say something, even if its just my name as part of the roll call and people care. In group dicussions everyone keeps looking back at me for approval and asking me what we should do. I bring up a point quietly even if theres already a conversation and people stop and listen like im going to tell them where the holy grail is. smart dickface does the same thing right after me and nobody could give a shit, even though he probably even has much better ideas to contribute than me.\\n\\nAs I write this I imagine some blue pill kid making jokes assuming that I\\'m completing delusional and toxic, but the way I see it is that the joke is really on him. Everything seems so much easier. \\n\\nI still haven\\'t launched myself into a social circle but hopefully things will fall into place soon.\\n\\nAnd yesterday I grew some balls and decided to ask a girl out. This was a real test of my frame but I fucking did it!\\n\\nI would have used emotions and interne slang in response to her using the old \"xD\" smile, but I took the red pill. I would have placed her on a pedestal asking her what times work best and would have worked around my schedule to be with her, but I took the red pill. I would have fallen into onetitis and mindfucked myself into seeing this girl as the one and my dream girl, but I took the red pill. She\\'s not a unicorn, she shits just like any human, bitches and manipulates other whenever it improves her position in life and isn\\'t a sweet innocent girl, she\\'s probably rode a hundred alpha cocks by now. I wouldn\\'t have asked at all out of pure fear of what she\\'ld think of me, but I took the red pill.\\n\\n\\nBut it\\'s more than just taking the red pill. That\\'s halve of the benefit. The other halve is you guys. The guys that make up this fucking awesome community. There\\'s nobody trying to sell me their book or pick-up course, just rational down to earth lads who have gave me more support and hope to achieve my dreams than mainstream society would have ever done. Thanks.\\n\\n**Tl;dr: Chose to take the red pill, got results.**',\n",

My life has improved immeasurably since discovering this subreddit and the red pill.  It is possible guys.  BELIEVE in YOU.  \\n\\nIt’s the greatest gift in the world. Every Man has a tool chest, it’s hardwired into his DNA.  Your ancestors survived countless tragedies and setbacks and still managed to continue their line.  You are the product of generation after generation of success.  …But you have been led down a garden path.  Sold a bridge.  Poor me, right?  Fuck that.  You don’t have to accept it.  You don’t have to let it depress you and resign you to a life in the passenger seat while women run roughshod over thousands of years of male domination and progress.  Remember, we let this happen by trusting women with power.  And we all know that power is dangerous in the hands of the unqualified.  \\n\\nTake control now. If your 15 or 60, it doesn’t matter.  Every day you breathe free is a day you will cherish.  Every interaction with a woman becomes fun and playful.  It isn’t all sunshine and lollipops but godammit you are a Man! You can take anything they throw at you and keep going like the Terminator. You are the one and only animal that conquered all the other animals, the world and himself.  You are a goddamn apex predator. Act accordingly. Find your inner animal and let it come out to play.  \\n\\nAnd the best thing of all: others can’t judge you because their votes don’t count for shit.  You are the only person you need to worry about pleasing.  You can take what you want from life’s buffet and leave all the shit you don’t need for the suckers who have to take what they can get.  Living an unapologetic Man’s life will make you feel like a kid skipping down the street again.  But blue pill or living like a drone will age you faster than you will ever believe.  And many of us, including myself formerly, do it voluntarily. Like a prisoner who never even checked to see if his cell is locked or unlocked.  Well, its unlocked guys, you just need to gather the confidence to stand up, kick the door open and walk out of the joint like a boss.

       "  'selftext': 'This post contains me using Mystery method tactics, CH tactics, and bits and pieces i have picked up on /r/redpill.  Thanks again gents and happy hunting!\\n\\nWent to the beach saturday with 2 of my boys.  As we were walking we saw 2 girls (HB8 blonde and HB7 latina) and the blonde gave my bro a nice smile.  My bro opened with “Hi” (simple and works), she said “hi”.  I asked where they were headed, to stop them from walking on.  They said a bar; I said, “why don’t you put that off for a minute and chill with us.”  They were from out of town, stuck on a layover on their way to south America.  Perfect lol.  At that exact moment, my other bro was getting picked up to go to a hockey game and we had a natural time constraint.  I tossed the blonde my phone and told her to give me her number, we will meet up with them in a few minutes.  She did as told and we parted…\\n\\n…45 minutes later, I texted her.  A game of missed calls/missed texts occurred as my remaining bro and I walked and stopped at bars.  While I was pissing at random bar, blondie texted me to come meet them - but when I went to get my bro he had already opened a new 2-set (lol another HB8 blonde and a 6.5 latina, déjà vu).  He told me later they had been ordering drinks near him and he opened with an indignant but playful, “…so where’s my shot?” which got the ball rolling.  \\n\\nWhen I returned I introduced myself and instantly stole the sunglasses off of blonde#2 head and put them on.  Both broads complimented me on the way the glasses looked, so I knew it was gonna go well. Started kinoing, touching a tattoo on Latina girl and then lifting up the back of blonde#2 shirt to “check” if she had tattoo in same spot.  They started return-firing kino at me and my boy.  Blonde2 told me, “I don’t like latin guys” I replied, “good I don’t like white girls.”  The gleam in her eye told of moisture forming down below lol.  Lots of laser eyes.  I let her catch me staring at her tits.  Shortly after found out Latina2 was married (but no ring on tonight cuz she likes attention, imagine that lol) and blondie2 had a boyfriend.  Found this out after I tried getting blonde2’s number and got blown out.  \\n\\nOnce me and my bro realized it was getting late and these chicks would take some work, we decided to shake and head home.  The girls were definitely surprised.  As we walked away to go home, I send a final text the blonde#1, “like ships in the night, maybe in another life, later.”  Imagine my surprise when she called me 20 seconds later.  I told her to be where we met in 1 minute or we are gone.  They were lol.  \\n\\nWe went to a new bar.  I took off the silly hat blonde1 had been wearing all day and put it on me, where it stayed for the rest of the night.  I started pawing at her playfully, which she returned.  A random girl walked by next to me, intending to give someone she knew a girlscout cookie; I stole it out of her hand and ate it.  The girl I stole it from smiled, laughed and gave me a dap.  The girls we were with lost their shit, laughing.   Blonde2 and Latina2 from the last bar suddenly appeared and placed themselves in proximity to us (now I wonder if they went there to find us lol).  So I said hi to them but didn’t invite them to join us.  This of course demonstrated to Blonde1 and Latina1 that we had other options.  \\n\\nI went in for the kiss on blonde1 but she turned to the side.  I was buzzed so I said fuck it and gently planted a single kiss on the tattoo behind her ear.  She said that was the first time someone has ever kissed her without her permission lol; she definitely liked it cuz laser eyes went into overdrive.  My boy was off with latina1 making out somewhere isolated.  Blonde1 qualified herself to me by bragging/putting down the texts she was getting constantly from other men she had met that day that were trying to meet up with her.  We flirted a bit more, kino, got her to give me a kiss on the cheek for a selfie.  \\n\\nThen me and boy said we had to split (tired from being at the beach all day and his gf was blowing up both our phones but we never answer). They were shocked.  A moment later, blonde1 asked if they could have a ride back to their hotel; I said sure but we should hit the hot tub to make it worth the drive.  They said they weren’t sure if their hotel had one but they were game.  \\n\\nOnce we were in their hotel room, I told blonde1, “hey this is a nice hotel, why don’t you show me the hallways…” with an evil smirk.  This was to give my boy a chance to get down with his chick and see if mine had warmed up a bit more.  She said, “…yeah, sure…”  Once we were outside in the hallway we were making out.  I led her to the ice machine room.  I put her against the wall and was making out, feeling her up, did that thing where I went from above lifted her bikini top and was playing with her nips.  She was going nuts, “I never sleep with guys the first time I meet em…”, basically ASD kicked in hard.  \\n\\nSuddenly I could hear my bro bellowing my name in the hallway.  He was ready to leave ASAP (latina1 didn’t want to fuck, just wanted to fool around and my bro wanted to split cuz he knew his wifey was pissed).  Kissed blonde1 goodbye.  She remembered my phone was back in her room so a few more kisses and we were gone.  She wants to meet up next time shes in town…\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Last night my girlfriend was painting a piece of furniture. She asked me how I felt about it, whether it was a good direction. I told her \"it\\'s great\" falling short on any enthusiasm while I smiled knowing she knew I didn\\'t give a fuck. She says \"You never care about this stuff!\" I look her straight in the eye and say \"Yes, because I\\'m not a faggot. Do you want to date a faggot?\" She laughed and said \"very true!\" and jumped on my lap to make out with me.\\n\\nYesterday she asked me to get her cupcakes she loved while I was in the city. I basically told her \"Nope, out of the way.\" \\n\\nThis morning she hinted to me I should go get her a coffee. She said on a scale from 1 to 10 how bad do you want to. I said .5. She then got a wide shit-eating grin on her face and said, \\n\\n\"I love that you don\\'t take shit from me. That you just say no. No...I really like that.\"\\n\\nBefore TRP I would\\'ve summoned up some fake enthusiasm about the furniture, went out of my way to find/buy her cupcakes. Then put on clothes and went to fetch her a coffee \"to be a nice boyfriend.\" I would\\'ve been doing what I thought was right. But really I be cutting up my own time while losing her one favor at a time.\\n\\nThanks TRP.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I don’t post a lot because the tools you have all given me lead me to be a pretty busy guy.  This one I had to write up because it was something different and something telling. \\n\\nA few months ago I made a post for no strings hookup.  One of responses was from a woman in another state.  She was very flattering toward me for my pic but more for my post; it was gruff, short, direct, specific and used non-pc language to ward off men from responding.  We exchanged a few emails where she explained she felt unfulfilled by the nightlife in her city.  I said, “hey, in another life…take it easy”  she said she might visit someday; I threw cold water on it, not looking to put any long term thoughts in her head.  \\n\\n…A few months later, I get an email that she is coming to my city and has purchased plane tickets.  I told her she had better have her own place to stay and explained my time with her would be limited to 1 meetup. she wanted to press on…\\n\\nThis weekend she was here.  I had the longest, most enjoyably depraved bout of sex in my life.  Checked a lot of boxes.  Not going to get into the nitty gritty but she was a goddamn maneater…and I tamed the tiger. \\n\\nWhen I met up with her (in public), I spent about 30 minutes feeling her out to make sure she wasn’t boil-a-bunny crazy (fucking roissy, the man can turn a phrase).  What followed was a sad indictment of the current state of beta males.  She complained about the men and the women in her city.  The men were soft, overweight, sedentary betas.  They couldn’t handle her sex drive, directness, or need for a strong man.  She said she had stopped dating for x number of months prior to coming out to meet me because the guys just weren’t worth it.  The women were all fat, entitled, bossy in a “born on third base and think they hit a home run” way, and of course, SJWs.  If a table next to you is too loud, the shhhhh policy show up.  Basically, liberal feminists run amok.  *Shudder*\\n\\nShe was attractive, fit, and petite, as far as looks go.  Not long term material but good enough for a one night stand.  Plus she was extremely direct and specific about what she liked sexually.  It didn’t take much time to decide to head to a bed.\\n \\nWhen it was all said and done, she had perma-smile.  Multiple o’s.  But heres the kicker: she basically worshipped me.  I have never had this happen before.  Very different. It was like I was Conan the destroyer and she was a girl in my harem. She moved over me catlike, she played with my chest hair, kissed and caressed every part of my body, basically acted like a cat when you give it catnip lol. I have had stuff similar to this happen before (laying on my chest, playing with chest hair, some girlish fawning, the ol’ pillow talk).  This was unequivocally beyond that.  I could have done anything to her and she would have done anything I said (trust me, I verified).  She would have been happy to do this shit all day and night, apparently. It was strange, unfamiliar and extremely hot.  It was the most manly I have ever felt; the confidence is dripping off of me currently. \\n\\nAll it cost me was twenty bucks.  I took her to 2 well known food places but nowhere touristy.  She flew to another state and all she got was marathon sex and fast food.  Didn’t give her a place to stay or act as chauffeur. \\n\\nHeres what I did:\\n\\n1.\\tShut the fuck up.  Didn’t talk at all while driving or waiting for food.  Answered her questions with brevity. Asked few questions but good ones (some from the list posted a few weeks ago on this site – the ones from the NYT).  \\n2.\\tBrought the wood. I think this more than anything is what made her believe my alpha state.  Giving a chick mind blowing orgasms makes their hamster pretty much forget/justify anything they don’t like about you lol. \\n3.\\tBody language in public.  I let her caress/be lovey-dovey in bed after sex.  But in public it was like she was a stranger.  This of course made her want to constantly touch me/show other women she was with me.  I would slightly shift or move away from her, enough to train her that she cant, aside from the occasional hand carass (her to me). \\n4.\\tWasn’t afraid to argue/disagree with her.  She kept trying to get me to see things from her perspective.  If it made sense to mine, I would give me slight agreement.  If it didn’t, I called bullshit. \\n5.\\tSet up (false haha) time constraints.  Made her freak out, kept trying to buy more time with me lol. \\n6.\\tWas fun &amp; playful, especially in bed. My roommate said all he heard all night was moaning then giggling, then moaning then giggling etc.  \\n\\nThis post was not to brag, believe it or not.  I felt it was my obligation to write this because roissy, rollo and redpill are doing more for men than anyone else and this story provides anecdotal proof that following red pill truths and the 16 commandants of poon leads to real world success.  Proof that there are unsatisfied women who will literally fly to another state for a taste of alpha.  Thank you fuckers, I love you all.  \\n',\n",

A life of Beta education is difficult to erase or question. Although I must confess at first I was Skeptic about it I decided to swallow and try, for I knew I had nothing to loose and everything to win. Now, I am a changed man. \\n\\nThanks to the red pill I know have these things in my life:\\n\\nA structured workout routine and a better health: I am sleeping 7 or 7.5 hours everyday, I\\'m hitting the gym 4 times a week, I\\'m eating healthily, drinking much less and a more satisfactory and less stressful life. \\n\\nStoic Philosophy: A wonderful piece of golden Knowledge that has helped me to cope with most things that before would have posed a great challenge for me are now easily resolved. I no longer have many concerns and I see everything rationally. \\n\\nA Desire to become the Best version of Myself: Before i wanted to go to college. Now I want to be a polymath, have a successful professional life and also have women, experiences and many, many goals.\\n\\nWomen: I am slowly seeing how this changes and how it becomes easier for me to get women to surround me. Ironically, now I am caring less and less about women and more and more about the Gym, my Goals and my Life. \\n\\nA quest: Thanks to the red Pill I have found that my purpose in life is to pursue and find the best version of myself I can attain. I finally understood rational self interest and why loving yourself will make others love you too.  ',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Two weeks ago, I got shafted at a presentation. Our purpose was to speak about three things:\\n\\n- An entire database structure I stood up\\n- An API I wrote for it to interface perfectly with:\\n- This guy\\'s copypasta\\'d web app he built while on a team in a separate branch in the company.\\n\\nHe asked me to give him a run-down on the system before the presentation. Me, being enthusiastic and proud of my accomplishments, gave him a grand tour. Come presentation time, he stole my tour verbatim. The entire time, he was belittling my accomplishments, and using \"we\" when I did something, and \"I\" when he did. But he was higher up in the chain. Not my boss, but I let him have his day, following whatever ground of Rule #1 of power this guy stood on.\\n\\nOver the course of the next day, I realized I had been played. The more I thought about it, rule #1 wasn\\'t in effect. *He wasn\\'t my boss*. Though much older (23 vs 40), he was brought from the other branch to assist *me*.\\n\\nWe had another minor presentation today, focusing on improvement of frequent tasks. I\\'ve deliberately been as vague as possible in my e-mails and communications to him regarding the system\\'s improvement. I allowed him the floor first, like before. He tried stealing my vague script again, and was blasted with questions. As much of a dick as it makes me seem, the schadenfreude in seeing him unable to answer them was euphoric. Every question was followed by a panicked look at myself, begging me to chime in. After a couple, I stood up, and suggested giving a more detailed explanation of the system\\'s improvements.\\n\\nBoss just came in to talk to me, and I focused entirely on body language, after reading a few great posts on it recently. He was impressed on the performance, and said it was clear who was really getting their hands dirty with this stuff. He said he saw through the guy\\'s BS last presentation, but glad I redeemed myself this time around.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I'll just be honest out of the gate: I've never been in the best shape, had the best credit, or been the most alpha guy in the room, but I figured out right after high school what the friend zone was, how I had put myself in the friend zone, why women were ridiculous, how relationships were bullshit, and why I wasn't getting laid.\\n\\nI hated women, and I guess that's part of the process. The rejection comes and comes and your confidence wanes right along with your sanity.\\n\\nThen I met my ex-girlfriend. Oops, spoiled the twist ending. We ended up living together eventually. She started looking for other dudes. I found out. We reconciled. She started it again. We broke up for good. \\n\\nI was devastated. I didn't know what to do. Seven years is a pretty long time. I spent the majority of my roaring twenties with one girl so I missed out on a big chunk of the fun times.\\n\\nAfter the breakup, I delved into online dating (read: made a huge fucking mistake). The first few months were the worst. I'd get angrier and angrier with each rejection. I'd send worthless hostile messages. I'd blow up their phones with constant texts and neediness.\\n\\nThen I got a bit of advice from the internet on how to use online dating and ended up banging some girls for a few months.\\n\\nbut then I started focusing on school and work. I lost contact with the broads. Once school was over, I off and on tried online dating, but it was back to the beginning even though I knew how to handle it.\\n\\nSo I'd step away, but then I'd get lonely and I'd try again. I don't even know why. Insanity perhaps. But, I reached that point where again, I hate all women.\\n\\nAnd then I found this sub. And as I read these posts I realized I was reading things I already knew: women were ridiculous, I was putting myself in the friendzone by not being confident and direct, and relationships were, in my opinion, still bullshit.\\n\\nOver time, the hatred waned. There's no use wasting energy hating something that is just the way it is. I can't hate the grass for being green or the ice for being slippery. That's just its nature. \\n\\nAlong this journey, I've lost quite a bit of weight. I'm 5'6. In high school and a few years after, I weighed 248lbs. My weight has yo-yo'd since then, but right now I'm down to 195lbs, and I work out at least 3 days a week (switching to four now). I still have a spare tire, but I'm working on it.\\n\\nIt's going to take a lot of time. I expect it to be at least 6 months until I'm in the place I want to be, and I fear I may have to forego dating/hooking up during the process. I want to be happy with myself first.\\n\\nSo thanks Redpill. You made me remember things I'd long forgotten when I came down with a helluva case of oneitis.\",\n",

Back at the end of November I started reading TRP, and everything I read really resonated with me, and so I started my journey. \\n\\nCue to now. I\\'ve been doing my weight training class for several weeks now, and I feel great. I\\'ve taken/taking women off the pedistal, I\\'ve started keto, and approaching women. I haven\\'t had a ton of success, but I will. Today a girl I used to be close with reached out to me. This is the second time in a  month. Before I ignored her because all she said was \"hey.\" This time, she said, \"Hey, I miss you.\" Now, back in my blue pill days I might have said I missed her too. I might have forgotten how she treated me. Leading me on only to start dating someone else a few weeks after she invited me up to visit her (She lives about 2 hours away). I have not forgotten, so I replied, \"I miss you too, miss you like I miss sharecropping.\" (I\\'m black and known for dark humor) She didn\\'t take this to kindly, and our short conversation practically ended there. \\n\\nI don\\'t give a fuck about her. I wash my hands of her. I know I\\'ll have to deal with her in the future as she is the best friend/roommate of one of my good friends, but I\\'ll be ready.

       "  'selftext': 'Found TRP about 6 months ago. Started out as a disgusting neckbeard fat beta. I have been lifting since and working heavily on my personality and game. I have tried several different frames over this time but I am starting to mesh into a 70%stoic/ 30%cocky-funny frame and I really like it. The biggest change for me is that I don\\'t say things unless I\\'m truly \"feeling it\". I won\\'t say something unless I think it\\'s pretty funny. I won\\'t tell someone a story unless I think it provides value. If I don\\'t have anything to say then I just don\\'t say anything. I\\'m making good progress but I am working on how to deal with those awkward silences when I don\\'t have anything to say.\\n\\n1.I\\'m a bouncer in a bar. This one older guy was talking to me one night and I don\\'t remember the specifics of the conversation but he said \"Yeah it\\'s all good bud, I served too so I know what it\\'s like.\" I told him I haven\\'t served but I\\'m thinking about it as a possibility for after college. He said \"Oh my bad, you just had that vibe.\"\\n\\n2.One of my good friends was a staff sergeant in the army. We were having some beers a few weeks back and he straight up told me \"I don\\'t know if you\\'ll know what any of these terms mean but in the army we referred to it as Alpha. Since I\\'ve known you, you\\'ve started to become more alpha.\" We proceeded to have an amazing conversation afterwards about what makes an Alpha and how beta most guys are these days.\\n\\n3.Last night I went out with some work friends. One of them said \"Oh look this place has a military discount Dad_Fister.\" I smiled because I knew where this was going. I said \"That\\'s pretty cool.\". He said \"What branch did you serve in again?\". I replied \"I\\'ve never actually served\". He said \"Oh really? I thought you did, you just have this attitude of \"I\\'ve seen some shit\". I told him with a smile on my face \"Haha, no that\\'s what happens when you go through a divorce.\"\\n\\n4.A girl told me that she likes my \"Take no shit demeanor and that I never complain.\"',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I\\'m not sure how many people are subbed to or visit this part of TRP, but I\\'ve been feeling really great about my life lately and I know it comes from me kicking my own ass into gear, but I just wanted to ThankTRP for helping me realize a few things:\\n\\n1. Abundance mentality is one of the greatest weapons in your arsenal that you can forge. I broke it off with a serious LTR about 5 months ago, and in that time, i have had a few ONS\\', a plate, and I\\'m finally on the verge of spinning up two more. Knowing that I have options is a huge advantage I have in the Sexual Market, and it shows in the way I interact. I walked away from a potential ONS because she put up too much LMR, but I may still spin her as a plate in the near future. But having her as one of my many options, rather than putting all my eggs in one basket has made me stand out against the other dudes that all throw their dicks in her face.\\n*Side note: Her ex-boyfriend that she dumped a couple months ago still lives in the basement and when I left the next day, I was told how she was screamed at and called all the names in the book; slut, whore, etc. instead of cultivating his own abundance and realizing that this chick is not a fucking unicorn, because they don\\'t exist*\\n\\n2. Lifting is one of the best things you can do for yourself, your confidence and your body. I\\'ll be the first to admit, during the holidays I was lax on getting a workout in, eating healthy (I do usually eat pretty well anyway, as fast food makes me sick within hours of eating it) But I\\'m back in the gym and it makes me wonder why I skipped any days in the first place. The gains I\\'ve seen from having a regular, healthy diet and getting a half-mile warmup with two different muscle group workouts in has helped tremendously, and even as I\\'m doing the workout in the gym, I can feel women checking me out and it feels amazing.\\n\\n3. Improve your life first, then let women chase you - Lifting is great, but I started with dumping my shitty ex-girlfriend, moved in with a friend and struggled for a month, then got a place of my own. I began lifting on day one with my friend and other than the holidays, I haven\\'t really skipped a day since. I also FINALLY went back to school - I moved to where I live now in order to get out of a different shitty situation only to find myself in a different one. And then a DIFFERENT one. But I took the plunge and invested in myself for once (After reading \"No More Mr. Nice Guy!\") and went back to school for Computer Science. I am enjoying learning all about the stuff I tinkered with on my own as a kid, and always wanted to formally learn and now I will be able to have a fulfilling career soon changing the world of technology somehow. None of that would have happened if I hadn\\'t found this place, and realized that it was time for me to stop supplicating to my girlfriends and create value in myself that women want to be around.\\n\\nWhen I started these changes, the Red Pill lifestyle, I was still with my ex. I frequented /r/deadbedrooms, and posted there. - Someone had to almost literally slap me through the computer screen with RP knowledge. He had RP something in his name, and I looked at his post history: There it was, \"The Red Pill. I was almost intimidated by the ominous notification at the top of the screen under the banner: YOU ARE NOT A MEMBER OF THIS COMMUNITY. PLEASE RESPECT THAT BY NOT VOTING. DO NOT CONCERN TROLL. THIS MEANS YOU. I read posts here. I began the sidebar, and NMMG, The Rational Male, all the newbie stuff. She told me while I was in the middle of NMMG, that she \"didn\\'t like who I was becoming.\" I was a blue pill beta who let her push me around and bent over backwards for her. She liked that comfort, and she was losing it. I quit my job, got a better one, started my first semester back in 6 years. She could see her control slipping, and that I was waking up. She liked when I\\'d cook her dinner every night, and rub her back, and watch her shitty vampire TV show with her and go to bed, with no sex. Put up with her untrained puppy that she wanted so badly, but had no time to feed or walk or clean up after. And she never even sucked my dick for any of that either. By the end, I was so livid with her that I nearly laughed when she meekly told me that she had cancer before I left her. (She didn\\'t, and doesn\\'t. It was her last attempt at getting me to stay) and the Anger Phase flooded me. All I saw was red. Now, I just laugh at their antics. I smash shit tests like my breakfast eggs. I watch their hamster spin. And I keep on lifting. Approach, dress well, all the shit they say on this sub is true. I\\'m just glad I found it when I did, if I hadn\\'t, I might be raising some other dude\\'s kid in a couple years from now.\\n\\nThat didn\\'t turn out to be such a short story, but fuck it, I\\'ve needed to let out some steam. I\\'ve seen a lot of the bullshit posted on Reddit lately, and I\\'ve been thinking about how this is one of the only actual real subreddits left.\\n\\nAll in all, Thanks TRP - For not letting me be an uneducated middle class worker-bee who could have been cuckolded into raising some other motherfucker\\'s kid, marrying a crazy woman who couldn\\'t even take care of a puppy, and bringing out the Alpha in me. I\\'ve killed the beta, Rollo. Thanks to you too.',\n",

Society doesn't care about me enough to hate me. There is no secret 'STUD' switch, and I AM the problem.\\n\\nThank you for your brutality. Holy fucking shit I needed the information in here. Even simple things like understanding my role as a man where things that I had never considered, even realised were important to defining who I am, who I will be. Now I'm starting a New Year going to the Gym for the first time, arranging events that my friends are dying to come to, even simply having the courage to tell people to go fuck themselves.\\n\\nThat didn't come from just reading all the information in the sidebar however, it came from me applying it. It came from me sitting down and asking myself 'How does this apply to me?'. And it's been hard. I used to be scared of walking in to a pub to hand in a C.V, nevermind approaching a girl I didn't know.\\n\\nSo am I now 'super-alpha'? Fuck no. I'm still a virgin, I still nervously laugh around incredibly attractive women and I STILL fidget like I'm trying to do algebra on my arm.\\n\\nBut I've a new found respect for myself, my fellow men AND women all because of this bastion and the questions it forced me to ask myself.\\n\\nGood shit.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Short history: I\\'m American, lived in South Korea last year and was miserable for reasons that I will mention in turn. During this time I found TRP, and at first used it only as a guide to better my health and mental state, but now I know how that goes.\\n\\nNow to the successes.\\n\\nCareer  improvement: I recently moved to Japan, which was a goal I\\'d had since I visited in 2010 and had a blast. The company I work for is small. I\\'m one of three full-time workers; the other are my boss and my good friend who helped me get the job. The work is lucrative for all those involved because my boss isn\\'t Japanese. Which means we aren\\'t expected to waste hours occupying a desk for the sake of appearances, extra work is paid, reasonable discussions of any issues can take place, etc. In addition, my boss likes me and depends on me, and is a workaholic who just had his first kid at 47. I have already begun to take the reigns.\\n\\nHealth: In the states and in Korea all I did was eat, smoke, or drink. In the US, I graduated university and immediately started working shit jobs that exhausted me for terrible pay to fend off student loans. This also many I was living with my father. Not shameful, but not fun. My free time consisted of smoking weed, drinking when there was no weed, and eating. I was fat before that, but that made me a fucking tub.\\n\\nWhen I went to Korea, the honeymoon phase ended pretty quickly. I quickly found that while the town I lived in wasn\\'t rural, it was  suburban and very far from major centers of activities. Now if you don\\'t know, the Korean national pastime is getting blackout drunk. Every night. Check out blackoutkorea.com for some funny and sad pictures. So, even though my day-to-day eating diet improved, I was still downing beer and liquor. Tub mode remained intact.\\n\\nToday my work out consisted of going three rounds with a girl, but usually I have a short but intense workout in my spare room. I do some weight-free workouts to strengthen my body and try to lessen pain that resulted from my previous weight; then muscle build with sandbags and free weights.\\n\\nLast but not least, SMV: Now, going from fat in university, to fat pot head, to fat drunkard  surprisingly did not help improve my almost nonexistent luck with women. I was beta my whole existence, and when I stated reading TRP I thought: \"No way this works. I don\\'t even want this to work. I\\'ll pick and choose what I feel comfortable with.\" Now, where I was, people didn\\'t learn conversational Korean. This made my social circle disturbingly incestuous due to constant new faces and departures. Two really trashy South Africans and one gold digging Korean later, anger phase for three months.\\n\\nToday I go out of my way to talk to everyone I think will interesting, not just women. I was social before, but now I network. When I used to drink and play video games; I now study Japanese, look for interesting things to do near my city, learn to cook something new, or just go to the mall and practice approaching in Japanese. I\\'m still fat, but there\\'s a nice layer of muscle under that, and there less fat every time I turn around. Of course it helps that I\\'m 6\\'2 and a white foreigner in Japan, but in six months I\\'ve gone from only having had bad sex with four women that were just warm bodies, to selecting who I\\'m fucking.\\n\\nTl;dr Thanks for being the politically incorrect manipulative assholes, guys. It very much saved my life.',\n",

I had an awesome year though, started a business, worked at jobs that I enjoyed, and did things for me and myself alone. I eventually found someone who seemed pretty alright, and I figured I'd approach a relationship with a bit of stuff I'd learned from MGTOW and TRP. \\n\\nI only talked to her when it was convenient for me, I never went out of my way to chase her. I only talked about myself if she asked. If she did ask, I'd talk about my travels, business exploits, side projects, etc. I (accurately) portrayed myself as a confident, rational innovator making decent money.\\n\\nNow I'm a pretty skinny dude, and I don't spend all that much time on my appearance (I'd say I'm around a 6 or 7), but just the fact that I focused on my limited alpha traits and stayed away from discussing feelings and emotional shit was enough. It fucking worked.\\n\\nI asked if she wanted to grab dinner, she agreed, but had something the next day and had to go home early. The next night went better and we ended up fucking at my house. We've had sex regularly for the past few weeks, and it's fucking awesome. There's more to the relationship than just sex, but the sex is a testament to how damn well this shit works.\\n\\nThe point is, I don't live by either TRP or MGTOW, but the concept of the alpha male is spot on, and I think that all men who are seeking a relationship should use this to their advantage.\\n\\nYou don't have to be filthy rich, you don't have to have Vulcan-esque levels of non-emotion, you don't even have to be all that good looking, TRP can still help you. Even applying the tiniest bit of RP theory can help you lead a better romantic life.\\n\\nA year ago I would have made every BP mistake in the book. I would have had no chance with this girl. Thanks TRP.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I haven't fully swallowed the pill there are still posts to read, life lessons  to learn and improvements to always be made.   I will say, however that the path of personal growth, realization of the role of males as disposable, and a red pill outlook of female sexual strategy and how to maximize off it has lead to me spinning plates at a rate that makes it difficult to continue.   \\n\\nI have had enough plates to realize that isnt what I am looking for anymore.   I wanted the soft harem.  I achieved it, but it was not really that great.   I had 3 different women in a week, and only one of them was interesting.   The others were just there.   I knew what to say and do to get them home and touch their giggly bits.  It was fun, but it wasn't what I am used to in a blue pill mindset, which is falling head over heels and just enjoying love.      \\n\\nI know that love is my genetic want to sacrifice for family and children, but when youre with a girl you want to do that shit for it makes the sex better.   The sex I have been having is good, great even, but it is missing that spark I want to take things to the next level.   \\n\\nSo now I have 3 girls that will come over and fuck if I send the right texts, and some of these girls will leave, and some will stay.   Some will get crazy or I will fade out on, others will stick around and be subjected to hair pulling and sexy romp sessions that end with a condom being tossed in a waste bin.    \\n\\nI need to refocus on finding a quality girl that makes me feel like a winner, rather than plates. \",\n",

Needless to say my girlfriend is a lot more attracted to me and is willing to do a lot more for a lot less effort I have put into the relationship (but I have put a lot more in myself, lost 18 pounds and am starting to lift and dress better).\\n\\nI kind of relaxed a little in the beginning of this year, not in front of her, but I did started reminiscing of how beautiful it would be if we could have that fairytale story, however I\\'m about to comeback to my redpill life (which even though it breaks your heart at first, you quickly start noticing how everyone respects you more and takes you more seriously because you aren\\'t opening your heart to everyone now).\\n\\nAnyway, today I was listening to Bruno Mars\\' Grenade and I was like \"no, she would never, ever, catch a grenade for me\" and I realized how heartbroken Bruno sounds when he says \"you won\\'t do the same\" (not saying he really even cares in real life though) and I got a little bit mad again, because I had HUGE expectations of finding a beautiful partner in life with whom I would be deeply in love with and have that fairytale story, but now I know that the moment I make my future wife my life she will start wishing an alpha dude and I can\\'t let that happen, I have to be the alpha.\\n\\nAnd in a way it does feel better to not have to depend on ANYONE to accomplish anything you want in this life, it feels great to know that the only person you have to make happy is YOURSELF.

       "  'selftext': 'December 27, 2013.\\n\\nI was sat alone in my room upstairs. I was still with my then girlfriend of ten years. Eight sexless years. Another year of a tonne of expensive lingerie bought for Christmas, already buried at the back of her wardrobe never to be worn and I\\'m feeling pretty alone in the world.\\n\\nExcept something was missing. The Christmas lack of sex argument. I\\'d given up trying for it a long time ago. It would only end negatively, it would only end in her calling me a predator or a rapist or some other shaming tactic. Instead, I had stepped up my game in the gym. I\\'d had personal training sessions, I was working harder and harder, I was living out a good job with some travel.\\n\\nMy body had improved over the last six years to a depressed, obese, smoking slob to someone else entirely. I didn\\'t even recognize my own pictures anymore. \\n\\nBut I was still alone. I sat reading r/deadbedrooms. Every post, every story, every syllable. I thought this problem was with me. I thought it was unreasonable for a 29 year old man to somehow expect sex from a girl or even have a right to it. I thought a man who made a move on a girl was a rapist. This is what my girlfriend of ten years had convinced me of. This was why I was miserable and struggling to get an erection over some of the slimiest, grottiest pornography the Internet had to offer.\\n\\nMy limp dick in hand, I happened upon r/deadbedrooms. I sat drinking a bottle of Chivas Regal. It was about 8am when I realized I had been up all night reading. I needed to go to bed. But the thought of sharing her bed made me sick.\\n\\nI spent the next few hours on the sofa, then when she woke up and told me I was stupid for staying up, I slept it off in the bedroom. Well, I tried to. She made sure to make plenty noise about her day.\\n\\nI\\'d made my own post in r/deadbedrooms. I didn\\'t know what to expect from it, I didn\\'t know what else they could tell me that I hadn\\'t already gleemed from the miles and miles of text, written by many sad and lonely men (and women!).\\n\\nI already knew I was done, I had my exit plan, I had a target of £7,000 to save to facilitate getting the flat in order for selling in March.\\n\\nMy girlfriend saw my change. I had become indignant. I didn\\'t care whether she was in the flat anymore, I didn\\'t hang out with her, I didn\\'t even return her texts. We met at dinner and that was it. We were pleasant enough to each other, but that was it.\\n\\nShe finally even tried to have sex with me. But I was too much gone. The attempt at reset sex sealed the deal for me. I was even slightly getting into it, I was eager to eat her pussy. But before I could even get her worked up she shut me down and told me that I was \"doing it wrong\". She laid there, even hit me and said, \"You\\'re not doing it right\" before storming out to get dressed.\\n\\nThe time came. I was on a business trip for a whole week to Amsterdam. At the end of the week, I was going to return home to tell her the flat was going on the market and we were splitting up.\\n\\nTwo days before I returned home, I met a girl at a hotel. I knew her from a few previous jobs ago. She wanted to go for drinks with me. I thought just as friends, the thought that a girl could be into me even slightly just didn\\'t occur. I was unfuckable. \\n\\nOne thing led to another. I had sex with her. But I felt nothing physically. It was like I was stomping my dick onto a cushion. But I loved that I felt together with someone. A real connection. It spun my head. I think I came from that. She laid back and, upon seeing the unearthly amount of cum on her pussy, she said \"Holy fuck!\". \\n\\nWe made plans to see each other again, she left the hotel the next day for her connecting flight.\\n\\nI was buzzed. I felt nothing physically, my dick was numb. I felt like years of zero sexuality had made me some sort of unfuckable half man half nothing. But my mind was supercharged. My mission: go home and tell her it was over. Technically, yes I had cheated. But had I really? Someone on r/deadbedrooms called me an asshole. Another one said I was justified, she had cheated on me first with the null partner by withdrawing sex.\\n\\nEither way, we were done.\\n\\nI demanded her attention. I told her what was happening, what she would expect and that she should make plans.\\n\\nShe was in tears, she told me sex wasn\\'t important. My Mom tried to reason with me, though she didn\\'t know about the no sex relationship.\\n\\nThe flat sale went through. I moved into my rented flat. My Mother was angry with me, she refused to take my calls. I had finally admitted what the problem had been. Given she was an Irish Catholic, I was even more of an asshole in her eyes.\\n\\nI spent my 30th birthday as the first night in my new flat totally alone. Nothing but the Internet and video games for company. My friends had deserted me wholly as she\\'d claimed I was abusive. My Mother didn\\'t even call me, I had nothing.\\n\\nSomeone mentioned The Red Pill to me. I took one look and wrote it off as woman hating. But then I read more. And read and read and read.\\n\\nLater, I applied the nofap rule to reclaim my sexuality and decrease the numbness of my dick, present due to constant strangle holded mastubation. Remember that girl I met up with in Amsterdam? Well she called me. Holy fuck. Two months without masturbation or even touching my dick. Physically, I could feel everything. I put my dick in her and it felt like nothing I had ever felt before. I came within three thrusts. \\n\\nShe was brilliant. I explained why, but she still wanted to see me.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t work out in the long run, but she will always have a special warm fuzzy place for being patient with me and being the first girl ever who was actually eager to fuck me.\\n\\nDecember 27th, 2014.\\n\\nNo long term girlfriend. I\\'ve had more plates than I ever thought I would have, I\\'ve never been this content sexually ever before in my life and instead of making blank, empty goals that mean nothing, they are thought out, clearly defined with where and how I\\'ll get there and an outlook on life that protects me against others but allows me to still let people far enough in to look up to me. \\n\\nI\\'m an alpha and proud of it. I may not be as alpha as you. But coming from the guy who spent 8 years begging for sex from one girl, it\\'s a pretty far way.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the secret? If I could wrap The Red Pill up into a few series of phrases, they would be:\\n\\n- Become the best version of yourself\\n- You have to start somewhere, here looks good!\\n- You don\\'t owe anyone anything\\n- Nobody owes you anything\\n- Who cares what others think. Do what you will do. Take risks and take them often\\n- Lift. Fucking lift. And when you\\'re done lifting, lift some more!\\n- Read the fucking sidebar!\\n\\nI\\'m amazed how much has change in LESS than a year. Don\\'t be me, don\\'t live your prime 20s being fucked over. Get out there, own yourself!',\n",

While I have used it in many situations there is one in particular that it has far exceled in.\\n\\nI have an ex that moved about 8 hours away.  In the time before her leaving and even for a while after I was full on Beta doing all the wrong things trying to rekindle what we had had.  I had a serious case of Oneitus and was really making myself miserable.  Prior to finding RedPill I was lifting and getting back into work more on the purpose of \"I will show her and make her regret!\"  \\n\\nSince starting to take in RedPill I am doing these things for myself and enjoying the fruits of my labors.  I began using scarcity and radio silence with the ex and cultivated some abundance mentality and a huge helping of self confidence.  In response I have started to see all sorts of FB likes, texts, phone calls etc.  When I do talk to her I get little comments about how \"It\\'s OK if you\\'re acting like an ass, I still like you\" etc.  I use some amused mastery about her liking my ass and move on.\\n\\nI realize it\\'s probably petty and something I need to move beyond but honestly, it\\'s a big boost to my self esteem to see her hamster spinning and working out just as so many posts around here talk about.

       "  'selftext': 'Context: I\\'ve been living an \"mgtow lifestyle\" since early this year when I broke up with my ex-girlfriend. It\\'s been an amazing year liberating myself from pursuing women sexually and conforming to society\\'s expectations. I\\'ve built a successful business in that time, improved myself mentally and physically...all the usual stuff men strive for.\\n\\nStory: This past weekend i flew out for an Xmas party. At the party I immediately noticed your typical beta pursuing a cute young girl there (6-6.5/10 internet standards) doing all the wrong things I learned from TRP. Dressed like shit, overweight, validation-seeking, the usual. I overheard her say that she sees him \"as a brother\". I chuckled. Game over for him. \\n\\nI don\\'t pay her any attention, socialize with others and carry myself well. Eventually me and said girl made some small talk, then I went back to ignoring her because I flew in for my friends, not to meet women. I can tell it drove her nuts. She was eyefucking me the rest of the night. We wind up alone and she obviously wants some tongue action, so I oblige for a bit. Back to ignoring her. It all just came so naturally. This kicked her into overdrive and she outright asked me to get a cab and fuck her. I literally spoke 15 sentences to her in the 3 hours since we met. I remember my pre-TRP days when I would see girls go off with guys who didn\\'t give two fucks about them. I was now that guy. \\n\\nIt somehow disgusted me how \"by the book\" this whole thing was, but I agreed to go home with her at the end of the night because I hadn\\'t been laid in a while. So I\\'m at her place fucking her hard and literally felt nothing. It was boring. The fact that TRP in practice worked so well turned me off from her. I would rather have stayed at the party with my friends. I left in the middle of the night and hoped she wouldn\\'t contact me again.\\n\\nAnyways, thank you TRP, because I would rather be me than the beta loser who got his crush taken away and pounded in front of his eyes.',\n",

Well, my sister always used to shit test me HARD, because i used to be a beta wussy, pleaser, bi-polar nightmare...exactly like her, incidentally. \\n\\nSo I've become more dominant, on controlling the environment, when around her. She frequently used to try and please me: gifts and clothes etc. I was always more of a dark triad 'dread game' exclusivist. But it left my game very one sided, and I wasn't getting the success i desired, so I've been adding to that base.  \\n\\nLike she was 'trying to make me a better man' but that always came at the cost of being abused for 'not being a good enough man'. And it's funny to see her coming around from outright hostile, as i sieze my own volition, and dominate hers. \\n\\nAll my sisters, responding much more energetically, as i polarize myself, and them. \\n\\nShe comes over today, with my daughter, and dad. Immediate attention grab, which i acknowledged, and ignored. I received the christmas gift, and ignored her almost entirely, and absent mindedly answered her pointed questions, while playing with my daughter(dread game)....she got huffy after a bit and i intervened and corrected her attitude. \\n\\nIt's what I feel, at this point, that's most important, because i can feel the attraction she feels for me, when i correct her, and dominate her, and teach her, and withold approval and attention. And it's only my hope that's exactly the gentle kind of practice it's gonna take to prove the reality of the confidence I've developed so far. \\n\\nIn the immortal words of the Red Pill master, Will Ferrell, 'Gator don't play no shit. Gator ain't never been about no shit' and yes, I've been using my dark side to get shit done: dominating and intervening with women like they want a strong man to do. I'm celebrating the small success of generating attraction with my sisters, and mom, knowing that that ability to generate gut-wrenching attraction, will place me in a position of power to have whatever i desire\",\n",

This was the first time I'd seen a website dedicated to male self improvement and I decided to delve into it by trying some of the activities the site recommended, like keeping a journal, making a daily and weekly cleaning schedule etc.\\n\\nWhilst reading it I decided to see if there was anything on it on reddit, as I was curious if there was anything else like it. One brash user had made a comment that the website Art of Manliness was shit and for faggots and that The Red Pill was so much better for self improvement. I wish I could thank who ever that was now for posting that link on reddit.\\n\\nThis year has been so much better for me compared to the previous 5 and I have the Red Pill to thank for it. I still have a long way to go to be where I want to be but I feel like I've been given a map I'd so desperately wanted ever since I was 18, to navigate life and how to overcome obstacles that have been laid before me.\\n\\nAs far as game goes, reading this sub as well as reading Roosh's BANG (again recommended from this sub) has helped me with getting 6 different lays this year, its a third of my total lay count all from just this year. Although all these ended up just being one night stands I still feel better for them, and my next goal is to try to obtain a plate. \\n\\nCareer wise I left a job I was doing for the past 4 years and hated for a new career path and haven't regretted the decision yet, the only thing I miss about it is the people I used to work with, since I left for a new city.\\n\\nI traveled Europe for 2 months earlier this year, had a blast with some fun stories to tell, and now I'm learning spanish so I can do a South America tour. I've recently learned that I have a thing for Latina chicks it seems.\\n\\nI've taken up the gym since March and had a lot more positive attention from girls because of it. \\n\\nAll of this wouldn't of happened if it wasn't for you guys. My next mission is to cut down on video games to a maximum of 1 hour a day, to totally quit watching let's plays on youtube.\\n\\nOnce again sincerely, Thank you.\\n\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hi The Red Pill,\\n\\nAllow me to introduce myself and thank this sub-reddit for all of the great advice, information, and unplugging happening here.  While I\\'ve been familiar with the Seduction sub-reddit and Game in general it was just a few days ago that I discovered TRP through u/JayGatsbyFan\\'s posts. I would say I was already somewhat on the path to this mentality but this is definitely a case of the *teacher* appearing when needed.  \\n\\nAfter many years as AFC I discovered PUA and Game when a friend lent me his copy of \"The Game.\"  This was a couple of years ago now.  Not having been terribly consistent at practicing game and having viewed running game as more of a hobby, I\\'ve only more recently been able to acheive a mLTR lifestyle with a rotating body of women.  I don\\'t necessarily focus so much on opening sets as I do at running natural game and generally just focusing on working on my inner game and presenting myself as an Alpha.  Seems to have worked pretty well because up until recently women have been coming to me in various different ways.  I have yet to bed what I would consider a 9 or 10 but I\\'ve dating some pretty solid 8s.  For a while there I was pretty confidently and assertively pursuing attractive women whenever they made themselves available to me.  \\n\\nThis brings me to the reason I am here.  I went soft.  I regressed to a blue pill mentality when I met this solid 8.5 four months ago and we \\'fell in love\\' or so I thought.  A solid 10 in the bedroom and the best fuck I\\'ve had consistently ever....my brain went full beta for her.  Cue crazy emotional tempests. Despite my best efforts to simultaneously assuage and set clear boundaries (i.e. hold frame) I was sunk.  While we weren\\'t dating exclusively, she was definitely my main plate and borderline gf.  I dodged the commitment bullet with her, but just barely.\\n\\nThere\\'s probably a lot here to break down and I\\'ll probably save it for a FR in the parent sub-reddit.  Suffice it to say in the past two weeks two of my other plates have dropped me.  And I broke up with the crazy emotional tempestuous one.  However I find myself nursing a single remaining plate, have some serious emotional wounds, my confidence is shaken, and have no new prospects.  Sure, I have a few orbiters who, after mostly neglect, I may be able to bring off the bench. I hadn\\'t realized how much I had invested in the one relationship thinking if I could just get through to the other side of it.  I thought, \"if I can just get this woman to calm down, I\\'ll have a consistently mind-blowing fuck for months...maybe years to come.\"  I mean...it just kept getting better.  She could push my buttons sexually, even those I didn\\'t know I had, better than anyone I\\'d ever met before.  Do I have a serious case of one-itis?  You bet I do.  Was her bullshit worth me nearly losing myself to the relationship?  Not on your life.  So, I did what any reasonable man could do, when I realized I was sinking, and I abandoned ship.  \\n\\nI\\'ve been devouring the all of the side-bar and the meat of TRP for the past few days.  I realize a lot of where I went wrong and I just wish I\\'d known about this before.  Basically a lot of it was one massive shit test.  A test which I failed.  It\\'s possible, although not likely given her level of crazy, that I might have been able to salvage the relationship with some serious Dread game and other tactics.  Life though sometimes is the best teacher.  Fail better, as they say.  \\n\\nSo, it\\'s time to lift myself out of the mire of depression and beta I allowed myself to sink into and start putting some of TRP to good use.   A humble and generous thank you to those who have done the hard work to create the content of this sub-reddit.  You have given me the tools I need to rebuild myself better.  A paradigm shift in my thinking has occurred.  There is no \"game\" anymore, only the *truth* of sexual fitness and being a Man.   \\n\\ngentleViking  \\n\\nEdit: spelling, grammar, punctuation, etc.  ',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'The first thing during this convo was she brought up my arrogance. When I first got into TRP I began to embrace it and her first reactions were loudly against it. Overtime I heard less and less of it and her words on it this night were \"It just makes it hard.\" But she said it with a smile. I loved how she couldn\\'t even say specifically what was hard but I figured it out. Made it hard to complain when she knew I thought I was always right and above her. Made it hard to be lazy when she saw me pushing forward without stopping to check and recheck things. Hard to betawhip me, I got it. \\n\\nSecond thing was she finally took a shot I called out months before as a prediction, that she would oafishly and with no tact try to shame me for getting in shape. She just started out that \"she doesn\\'t like me doing this Arnold Schwaztenager thing\" and I shut her down fast with \"Does that make you feel bad about your own body?\" She spent 10 minutes after that on the defensive while I tuned out a bit and just kept a somewhat judgmental cringe on my face. I\\'m designing some plays to get her working out it just isn\\'t time yet.\\n\\nThird was I realized I got control of my beta selfs total lack of abundance mentality. She was surprised I said I wouldnt mind at all if she went to some club without me. Beta me would\\'ve been all torn up about this but I told her I\\'d love for her to do this because I was looking forward to not hearing her complain about taking weekend trips by myself (I can afford to travel, she cant). She pretty much showed her hand right away after that saying shed be way too jealous and she just wanted me to act jealous too. \\n\\nI know I still got a long way to go. I know the war never ends and the battlefield deceiving. But fucken hell yea to the TRP. \\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"   I came across TRP as a result of desperation and exasperation with my 13 year marriage and wife. At first glance, I thought it was mainly rants by the male version of neo-feminists, so I dismissed it and kept searching for answers. But something brought me back.\\n\\n   I've been reading and attempting to digest the info for a week now.  Addictively. Like lost sleep because I can't get enough. The articles and posts have caused epiphany after epiphany as I look back over my adult life. I see quite clearly now that I am (was) a Beta with a capital B. I THOUGHT it was what I was SUPPOSED to do. \\n\\n   I'm going to share a couple things that happened in the last two days. Two nights ago, wife is pissed or distraught about something, and, of course, I dared not say anything to prevent an argument. Snuck upstairs and pretended to be asleep. The next morning, as I'm leaving for work, same thing. Cold stares, icy expressions, talking to the kids, but not me.\\n\\n   As I sat in my car, ready to leave for work, I thought screw it, I'll give this TRP thing a try. I texted her the following: 'I don't know what's wrong with you, but tonight we ARE going to discuss it'. I swear, I damn near had to throw my phone out of the car to keep from sending a follow-up text that said 'I'm sorry' or 'we can talk when you're ready'. Like seriously, broke out in a sweat.\\n\\n   The day goes by and no return text. That night, I get home and she's drunk and passed out in bed. Next morning, I repeat the same text with the addition of telling her not to get drunk or plan any kids activities to escape talking.\\n\\n   I truly have no idea where this stuff came from, but I began and ended the conversation in a few sentences. I told her our sex life was terrible (long standing argument) and without her active participation, I didn't see it viable to stay married to her long term. I added that I USED to tell her, no BEG her, to initiate sex because that's how I got my self-worth and value, and I needed to feel needed, but this is no longer the case. I now have plenty of self worth (a lie) because I'm a great father, a high income earner, good looking, have a big heart and a big cock. And if she didn't value those things, it doesn't mean that the rest of woman kind would not.\\n\\nI shit you not, 20 mins later, she snuggles up to me and asks me to pound her doggie style. I think she would have done anything I asked. This has NEVER happened in 13 years.\\n\\n   So now, as I sit and think through this week, I'm torn between utter astonishment that TRP actually works and bitter sadness and anger that I wasted 23 years of my adult life being a beta.\\n\\n   Sorry the long post, my first one ever. I just wanted to extend a heartfelt thank you to those who share TRP info and stories and that it really does change lives. It is changing mine. I'm never going back. Ever.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'First off I want to say that this is a throwaway account, this is still otherwise my first post, and sorry for any grammatical errors; this is long.\\n\\nI believe I found TRP like a lot of people. It was around the time of the Isla Vista shooting. My other favorite subreddit is AskReddit. And the rest is history. lol\\n\\nI was on a level of blue pill that made you cringe, but hope was right under the surface, luckily. Women have always told me that I was an 8 (occasional 9 and 7) consistently, and I am also pretty funny, so its not like I had a disadvantage there, it was my game. I had none. A girl I was \"friend-zoned\" by at age 15 even told me, \"You have no game.\" It resonated with me ever since. She was one of the first women to reject me in my pathetic long run of rejections. I couldn\\'t get a girlfriend for over 6 years (starting from age 13). I even counted over 40 different women, by the time I was in 10th grade, that I legitimately tried to make my girlfriend, but they all rejected me. That number has to be over 100 by now. lol\\n\\nI would look up videos on \"how to get a girl to like me,\" \"how to make the move,\" \"how to tell if a girl likes you,\" etc. Some of them were slightly helpful, but most of them were adding to my Betaness. I would also ask women I knew, who rejected me, how to get a girl to like me; they do not know what the fuck they want. But its not like I couldn\\'t get a girlfriend, I just couldn\\'t get the ones that I pursued. I even got laid at 15, nothing happened for 2 years, and then had my first kiss at 17 (i know..she was ugly).\\n\\nGame Changer. (Jump to May 2014)\\n\\nI am completely wrapped up in this girl that will make out with me, grind on me while in her panties on my bed, but will never have sex with me. I\\'m also extremely depressed because she added to the feeling of never being able to get a girl friend. She claims she \"doesn\\'t want sex,\" but I know that it was complete bullshit after talking with her a couple of weeks ago.\\n\\nI find TRP. I start off by reading some of the posts after arriving to the front page for the first time. Everyone\\'s field report that had success always seemed to start off like my story in one way or another, so I knew i was in the right place, but I didn\\'t want to accept everything thrown at me immediately. I started reading some things that would go against my BP tendencies and I rejected it for about 3 weeks and was a little mad/sad at myself, and at a disbelief... But when I read [Michael\\'s Story](http://tinyurl.com/k5ssboo) , Everything changed. My mind went from \"getting some information\" to immersed in the world of TRP.\\n\\nIn the first stages of it which is like (2 months ago), I thought I was the shit because I knew about \"all\" of the things women would do. I went to the club that night, but I didn\\'t even know what a shit test was. lol. I failed miserably that day.\\n\\nI then take about a week to read all of the side bar and utilize it next time I went out. While reading it I was feeling so energetic and enlightened at every moment that I just knew I would see results. I go to a party with my friend on a friday, and I see one of the hundred. She is looking gorgeous, and I\\'m feeling nervous. But no, I walk up to her, sitting in the middle of the party around the bonfire with all of her other attractive friends, and talk to her in front of everyone. She is excited to see me since we hadn\\'t seen each other in about a year, and the night follows. I hurdle over her few shit tests, and I have her and her friends laughing every time I want them to. But a guy got hit by a car out front and everyone was screaming and what not, so I didn\\'t have the opportunity to close, and plus I was still nervous so I\\'m glad I didn\\'t have to that night.\\n\\nWeeks pass by and I\\'m still refining my game, but nothing better than the first night happens. Until I remember that I am going on a 6 hours trip to see some family and I need an audiobook to listen to. I search TRP for \"audiobook\" and I see the Art of Seduction somewhere. It sparks a memory of a sone by J. Cole where he says, \"Art of Seduction, hoes jump like Vince Carter, backstage like they part of production.\"...I wanted a girl to jump on my erect penis, so I googled The Art of Seduction. I find [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjuFbRLv3xA&amp;list=PL8E6A46042A67A141) and my entire life has turned around. I don\\'t know Robert Greene, the author, but I wish I was being paid by him or the publishers. Everything he would say would bring up a memory of a girl who rejected me and I\\'d understand why I was so into her.\\n\\nI listened to it 3 times in the first week and about 7 in total now. Women I know, some even girlfriends of my friends, are into me now (Getting over shit tests are key). I\\'ve been lifting. But surprisingly, the results came from a lot more people than just the women I would attempt to seduce. People who hung with me for a day would try to be like me; I would notice their behaviors and actions would follow mine like phone usage, things I say, and even how I walk. And more people would try to do little things to impress me. It\\'s a weird feeling when you see it, but I\\'ll get used to it... everything can\\'t last exceptionally well for too long though.\\n\\nLast month my mother passed away. I\\'m a 19 year old only child soon to be living with one of my mother\\'s friends in a new area. Honestly, If I hadn\\'t found TRP, I would be with my mother. I know everything gets better with time and it has been hard to keep negative thoughts away (to be as vague as possible), but now I just think of the life I have the ability to create, and I want that more than anything else at this point.\\n\\nThough The Red Pill has some understandably negative connotations, it has truly saved my life.\\n\\nThank You TRP!\\n\\nedit: Added the 2 missing links.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I orbited this one girl for years, probably from age 8 to 24 or so. All the usual awful shit. Around grad school, I realized that my higher earning potential had opened up the door to top-notch 19-22 year olds and started banging a 19-year-old college freshman (to my feminist friends\\' horror.) \\n\\nThis one girl I orbited none the less kept in touch over the years, even though I\\'d dropped off the map WRT to her. She used to love to go invisible on Gchat and text me whenever she got bored, creating \\'demand\\' for me to be in contact with her, which she would ignore. Whenever I got tired of this after a while and would stop texting her on gchat for a few weeks/months, she\\'d get this started again. \\n\\nEventually, during the first 19 year old girl time, I just put this girl on gchat ignore for like 2-3 years. She later emailed me to \"reconnect\", but I\\'m sure it was just to make her boyfriend (now fiance) jealous. So we met up 2-3x before I moved out of town. \\n\\nThe 19-year old girl ended and I am now with a second girl that just turned 22 (I\\'m 30), and this woman I orbited from age 8 is now 30 as well. Her butt has fallen and her thighs are thicker. She\\'s not fat; she just looks 30 and not 22. \\n\\nAnyway, about a couple months ago the girl I orbited for years emailed me to tell me she has late stage breast cancer and yadda yadda yadda...and I kept meaning to reply, but I wanted to write a more serious and meaningful email than \"Sorry...you have my support, etc\" but I kept putting it off because I was always hanging out with/banging this 22-year-old in my time out of the office. Eventually--after about 5 weeks--I did write a one sentence email to the cancer girl but when she emailed me back, I spent last night doing all kinds of freaky shit with a 22-year-old girl. I guess, I should email her back, but I keep thinking, \"Thanks TRP for getting me out of the matrix...I truly don\\'f GAF about this girl I would have jumped in front of a train for, ages 8-23.',\n",

I\\'m a lot more comfortable expanding my work now I know how to continue in a ladylike and polite manner *without* giving the wrong impression.\\n\\nI\\'d like to thank everyone at TRP for illustrating to me how men and women work in terms of all sorts of interpersonal relationships, for showing me why certain types of women act in a certain way and why men and women are in so much conflict in the modern world. All this has cleared up so many points of confusion to me as well as given me material to work my own theories out and apply them, with varying success, to my life. The reduction in drama and stress simply from knowing when to cut someone out, when to push them and when to let them recover is astonishing.\\n\\nAnd I\\'d like to thank the girls over at RPW for providing the harsh reminder that even girls who check off a lot of \"unicorn boxes\" are fallible and replaceable, that I am always a work in progress and that I do possess many negative feminine traits; as well as the gentle support I need when less traditional women and feminist individuals in my life start acting up and hamstering at me.\\n\\nOverall, I have managed to cut out of my life those people who were a drain on me and those relationships that were negatively impacting both sides, to improve my relationship with my students and to reduce the stress of dealing with certain male or female behaviours that were confusing and frustrating to me. My life is so much more pleasant and easier now that all that mess is off my shoulders. I am grateful and look forward to learning more.',\n",

Until now I\\'ve been focusing mainly on getting my life in order and I thought that I could just neglect comprehending Feminism as whole, at least until I found some footing for myself. But the further I read and learned about female behavior and SMV the more I realized how gargantuan a factor it is. \\n\\n\"Feminism is fucking genius!\" The exact words I uttered last night at 2 in the morning (I couldn\\'t sleep)\\n\\nIn light of the recent video about that girl who walks through NYC and gets hit on by low SMV men, the concept of SMV and how feminism is basically just a filter for ugly, poor, beta guys finally clicked for me. You guys have opened my eyes yet again: I am a low SMV male. \\n\\nI finally understand why I have always disliked Feminism, but realizing what it is allows me to not only appreciate the evil genius behind it, but also how to approach it. \\n\\nSo thanks again TRP',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Today I faced my \\'friend\\'/bully. Let’s call him B. B has always been a short fuse ( his dad was never around and probably never loved him) and I feel has always had something against me... We both have very alpha personalities, but I\\'m more relaxed. We also share many friends.\\n\\n\\nAnytime I say something, he refutes me and tries to come out as the \\'winner\\'... not really use logic or reason, but just being loud, talking over me, attempting to be \\'dominant\\', and overall trying to bring me down. It’s always against me, and not really against anyone within our circle of friends. \\n\\n\\n\\nSo we were at a party, and his bitchy girlfriend said a rude remark about how my ex-gf was too good for me. I kept frame, told her this behavior was unacceptable and put that little girl in her place. He notices and tries picking on me, but I\\'m not having any of it (again, he\\'s being loud, dominant, getting close to my face, up to the point where I can smell his breathe). I remain calm and don\\'t say anything. I don\\'t even look at him or acknowledge him when he\\'s bitching me out. After he\\'s done, I walk away, grab a beer, and go hang out outside. \\n\\n\\n\\nThey\\'re my ride home and now were leaving the party. B is driving and im front passenger. His bitch gf (btw she put B in jail and he\\'s still with her... chump) and her friend are in the back. While in the car, the arguing between B and I start again. Don\\'t know how it started. Now he\\'s talking shit and doing his usual stuff, and again, I\\'m not acknowledging him. He tells me to look at him when he\\'s talking to me (lol as if he were my dad). I turn around, look at him in the eye, and say \"fuck you \". B says he\\'s going to kick my ass blah blah blah. The girls in the back are egging him on.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoor bastard listened to them. He got out of the car, and so did I. His fists clenched -- ready to fight me -- and mine clenched twice as fast. He says he\\'s going to knock me out and leave me on the ground… blah blah blah. B comes towards me but I step back. He keeps coming towards me but I keep stepping back. I honestly didn\\'t want to fight him, but I was tired of stepping back and I decided to defend myself. I throw a punch and it connects with his chin. His body dropped to the ground, smacking his face in the pavement. He stands up, comes towards me, but again I step back. I could have kicked him and punched him while he was down, but I had proven my point and was done with him. Instead of continuing to come towards me, he gets in the car and drives. I ran away and hid in an alley because I thought the crazy mofo was going to run me over lol\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following is a txt conversation between him and I minutes after:\\nB: You\\'re a fucking bitch. You fucking pussy. I was only trying to help you you dumb ass piece of shit.\\nMe: Don\\'t contact me ever again. I\\'m done with you.\\n\\nFrom what I have been told, he\\'s been spreading rumors that he was \\'trying to help me\\'. Haha. He’s full of shit and has no honor. He could have just stayed quiet and taken the beating like a man, but instead he took the bitch-road. I honestly think he’s trying to save face (especially since his gf witnessed his ass get beat) and is trying to turn people against me. It’s okay tho, I can make new friends \\uf04a I know who I am, and I know what happened. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat I Learned:\\n1) He\\'s not my friend\\n2) It’s not worth getting into fights. I could have easily killed him with that punch. What if he had fallen and smacked his head on the concrete and died? I\\'d be facing serious charges! (It was self-defense, but still…)\\n\\n\\n\\nI swallowed the RP about 4 months ago and I’ve been more confident in myself ever since. Thank you guys for helping me become a better man, and indirectly helping me stand up against my fears and bully.\\n\\n\\nThe road aint over, and I have a lot to learn!\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Weezer is the reason I got divorced. lol not literally, but the more I look at the world of media I consumed so thirstily my entire life from a post-red pill vantage, the more I see how I was willingly indoctrinated into the feminist state.   \\n\\nThe other night I was back from partying and i couldn\\'t fall asleep because of all the coke I had done.   I finally put on a movie hoping to allay the power of the booger sugar, a blu ray I picked up the day before – “Back to School.”  I was born in the early 80s,   so I grew up watching inappropriate 80s cinema filled with violence, profanity and lots of tits and ass with my old man (funny how every dude you know wishes Hollywood still made movies “like they did in the 80s.”  Go google Walter Hill.  Watch everything he directed and you will have plenty of testosterone soaked cinema).  I saw “Back to School” on the shelf at the store and fond memories come flooding back.  Rodney busting the chops of a snooty English professor.   Sam Kinison electrifying his only scene with a Vietnam rant in history class.  And fucking Oingo Boingo rocking a college party, as was normal in the 80s.  \\n\\nWhat I didn’t remember was the blue pill.  Rodney’s college age son’s entire plot in the film is…he has a crush on a girl who could be *the one* and he spends half the movie working up the courage to *talk* to her.  That’s it. Pretty fucking thin right? But for a blue piller, its catnip.  This bitch is *the one*, the special snowflake who if he could just qualify to, if he could just get to *see* how valuable he is, she would melt and they would fall in love, get married and the rest of the Disney shit you already know.   Fuck me.  It was like a sock in the stomach.  I have hundreds of movies in my dvd collection.  Guess what? A LOT of the movies I own have this as the main plot.  When a character spends several scenes working up the courage to go *talk* to a bitch, you know its pure blue pill propaganda.  I turned it off after I found myself rooting for the asshole alpha guy that Betaboy is competing against for the girl’s attention.  I think the alpha dude was the bad guy in Karate Kid, so I really should have no reason to ever support him or want to see him succeed. But there I was.  And knowing the alpha would get put in his place in the end and Betaboy would win the girl made my stomach churn.\\n\\nAnyways, back to Weezer.  The “blue album” and Pinkerton formed a large part of my previous idealization of women (now corrected haha), I have realized.  I guess it was because I was 12-13 when the blue album hit and I really found everything that Rivers was saying to be a beautiful fantasy of my future to come.   From the lush, emotionally sappy descriptions in “Only In Dreams” to his idealized ‘perfect girl’ in “My Girl,” the “I am proud to be a pussy” vibe is strong across their entire oeuvre.  The guy wrote a song called, “Tired of Sex” where he describes the existential ennui that accompanies banging slews of groupies night after night, and the longing he felt for that one special girl that if he could just find, would complete his whole world.  I ate that shit up with a spoon, naturally, being 13 and overweight.  “Promiscuous sex with lots of women? No thanks, I think I’ll just fuck one bitch for the rest of my days and jack off all the time to fill the void.”  I can’t believe I used to think this dude was a rock star…\\nI am a musician now and I still enjoy Weezer for their fantastic grooves and melodies, memorable guitar solos and its place in my adolescence.  I love all music.  Even my most disliked genre, country contains one of favorite musicians, Johnny Cash.  \\n \\nBut as I grew older Weezer just seemed gayer and gayer, but I always defended the blue album and Pinkerton.  Shit like “Beverly Hills” seemed to confirm they went up their own ass. \\n\\n…I am not deleting my Weezer albums or taking Back to School to the goodwill.  But I am definitely more aware of the insidious nature of the blue pill.  If rock n roll and college sex movies are filled to the brim with subliminal blue pill shit, what chance do the youngings have?  The red pill is the only hope. \\n',\n",

To be brief I just needed to contribute to this subreddit, after all, long time lurker etc. first things first, I\\'m on a phone so apologies for layout etc.\\n\\nAnyway, I found out about trp about 12 months ago and have since started adopting a lot of trp principles. At first it was bitter, I lost friends who couldn\\'t handle what I was becoming. A \"gym junkie douche\" cause being a weed smoking gamer gets you laid? Pffft! \\n\\nFriends thought I was harsh on their girlfriends/friend girls. And I struggled with adopting the mindset of women aren\\'t men and can\\'t be conversed with logically, or reasoned with. I found it especially difficult to reason with them after I swallowed the pill and became aware of their hamstering and emotional victimised bias. I just couldn\\'t believe their arguments weren\\'t grounded in logic.\\n\\nBut now that I\\'ve come full circle, life is sweeter, the new friends I\\'ve made are more reliable, more loyal and genuine, (I\\'m big into loyalty, I can\\'t stand back stabbers or liars, also fakers just grate my nerves) \\nI\\'m happier then ever, being me, doing things for me, making me happy.

Every couple I saw where the woman was attractive she was a bitch and the man she was with was not as deserving of having such a sexy woman as I so clearly was. Every attractive girl in general was a bitch and I hated the way they wouldn't respond to me trying to make eye contact with them.\\n\\nI hated gangsta rappers, footballers and any other successful alpha types I hated beautiful women and if any guy so much as dared suggest that he was good with women he was my mortal enemy. In short I was a miserable ball of frustrated beta rage.\\n\\nThen 2 months ago I found this place. I was aware of PUA but I didn't think much of it and the MRA stuff I found seemed more about how unfair it was that they couldn't have sex when they wanted than about improving men in general.\\n\\nThis place however opened my eyes in a way that I never thought possible. Suddenly everything made sense. I read NMMNG twice, I read Rational Male, I was here all the time. Within two weeks my hate was gone. It's like it was never there.\\n\\nNow when I see a couple holding hands the only thought that runs through my head is whether she's attractive or not and if she is she might get a grin. Even if she isn't she might anyway. The guy doesn't register. If I see a pretty girl in the street she always gets a grin and in any case I'm usually walking around with a huge smile on my face anyway.\\n\\nThe funny thing is that my circumstances haven't changed. I'm still not having dirty monkey sex with hot 22 year olds (I might be back here again if that happens) but now that the centre of my universe is me, my life is a pleasure and all my rage and hatred is a memory. Except for cyclists in pedestrian areas. I still fucking hate those fuckers.\",\n",

For the first time in my life, my chest sticks out over my ribs. I have a ways to go just getting back my judo muscles, but it\\'s real progress.\\n\\nLast night I put on a fitted t-shirt that accentuates this. My ex came over (she\\'s in orbit with an LTR; getting free of being shacked up with her is an epic tale for another time), and freaked out. \"looking good ex bf\", musing about how the new BF needs to start lifting (he does, he\\'s skinny), etc.\\n\\nWhen I got to the club, the difference was subtle but unmistakeable. As I mentioned, my SMV in context is high and my frame pretty clear; this is my home spot and I spend a lot of time flirting with women who aren\\'t on the radar for various reasons, primarily being sub-8. \\n\\nLast night, about 6-8 of them touched me on the chest, or at the cap of my bicep.

I found myself doing TRP tactics before I even used reddit. My point is, and yes I know I sound like an arrogant douche, I've always been somewhat of an alpha, like bottom level lol.\\n\\nAfter stumbling onto TRP by, you can guess it, shit talk in another subforum, I learned more about myself in three months than I have in my entire life. Reading a thread explaining dread game and instantly thinking of 2+ instances of using that specific tactic gave me such a content feeling. I felt like I was normal.\\n\\nBefore discovering TRP, I always assumed that I was just an asshole. A real prick in nature. I felt this way because I've had many women tell me this. I have to admit, despite my natural tactics reflecting many TRP ideas, I didn't understand women at fucking all. One could see how my perspective about myself could be skewed by women constantly telling me how mean I am and that I'm a plain dick.\\n\\nWhy did so many women call me these names? Well TRP really slapped me hard and woke me the fuck up because damn do I feel stupid looking back on it now. So many women hated me because of the complex relationships women have with each other. One day I'm hooking up with a beautiful girl, she wants to be exclusive and I say no. Next day, her friend is calling me asking to hang out and I say yea, why not fuck. Third day in the story and all of the first hookup friends would treat me like I murdered their fucking family. This is, of course, a completely simplified situation.\\n\\nWith rambling mode off, TRP really opened my eyes to the fact that this behavior from men and women is to be expected. We are all slaves to biology and shit, there's a reason human beings have gone this far, we love to fuck. Being clueless and ignorant, all of these angry girls truly made me believe that my personality was sour. This in turn took a big blow to my confidence, how can I be confident when I'm literally ashamed of my behavior with women?

Oh and started lifting!\\n\\nNow that that's out of the way, let me share my enthusiasm for this unique community. TRP is the unicorn of internet communities and a fucking holy grail in deep shit that is Reddit.\\n\\nHere is what in my eyes separates TRP from the rest (not considering the obvious: the content) :\\n\\nBullshit is rare here. I don't know if it's the mods or just general quality of people here but this point is I think the most obvious once you lurk for at least a minute. People go straight to the point.\\n\\nNo dick measuring. For such masculine community there is extremely low amount of chest-beating or other locker-room proving-grounds drama.\\n\\nHonesty-to-Butthurt ratio. This one amazes me. There is a lot of calling people out on their claims but rarely there is any poison in the response. Most disagreements seem to go as far to agree to disagree and no further.\\n\\nNo grammar nazis. This one is huge! I saw a share of grammar slights in posts here yet nobody calls this out. We err. We are mixed community with non-native English speakers. Misteaks are bound to happen. I felt this reflex to correct first couple of these but once I saw it is not even considered important enough to pollute the sub with ..you're comments I realized how petty this is.\\n\\nCamaraderie. Nowhere on the web have I felt such natural connection. Not based on feeeelz and &lt;3 and mutual back-rubbing, but genuine respect. Respect for oneself allows one to relax the defensive mindset and to naturally recognize others' value without the feeling one lowers himself by admitting it.\\n\\nCoolness. This sub is hated. It is contra. It is an underground guerrilla fraternity and it just feels right (don't stone me!) to be a part of it.\\n\\nAnyway, this is my thanks to this wondrous corner of web which has added so much to so many lives! (seriously, changing the life of 76 000 men is a damn impressive accomplishment).\",\n",

The 'mean' posts were a shock to beta me at the time, but they gave an extra kick that I needed and deserved so that I could begin to change who I was.\\nSince, I have been lurking, reading the sidebar and making notes, and overall improving who I am, as do most men who embrace TRP properly (judging by other thankTRP posts). TRP has been infinitely valuable to my life, as I had some of it in me pre-TRP, I just couldn't express it or hold frame enough for it to be effective. As I am 18 years old, I am grateful that I can have this positive influence on me in my journey of becoming less of a boy and more of a man.\\n\\nI owe a lot to the more experienced members who took time to comment and help me, askTRP is a very valuable resource. Some guys are lost causes, but some guys are struggling beta's like me who need the advice. Even if it is just to 1. lift 2. read the fucking sidebar. If you answer someone's askTRP, you may just rescue them.\\n\\nI would like to mention /u/newpopehere1 , /u/mccdizzie /u/tigolbittiez and /u/-Tyler_Durden-, your posts were particularly helpful.

       "  'selftext': 'It is wonderful to finally have a sexual strategy and understand the *real* dynamics of human sexuality. Not Disney movies, not what your mom tells you, not what women tell you they are attracted to, but the real life observed *reality* of human sexual interaction.\\n\\nA little backstory:\\n\\nWhen I was about 13 or 14 I had a few different girls who crushed on my big time and vied for my attention, even though I hadn\\'t even really hit my main development (testosterone explosion), I was oblivious and aloof, I had no clue that this pedestalization-free behavior was exactly what attracted girls in the first place. Queue my mid-to-late teens, when my testosterone is absolutely raging and I have this drive I can\\'t control and don\\'t know what to do with, way too much emotional investment/commitment way too soon, every girl I pursued would give me a LJBF\\'s speech.\\n\\nPost red-pill I realized that masculine attracts feminine and vice-versa. My whole life I thought if I just emulated their emotionally-sensitive behavior the whole time I would be the Perfect Man™ and find The One© I would eventually marry. Boy was I duped. Suddenly everything clicked for me! It\\'s still a struggle (never having had a strong male mentor) and I have a long way to go since I am on a continual journey to better myself and be the strongest, most intelligent, alpha provider that I can be (the life path I have chosen to take).\\n\\nSo.. THANK YOU, Red Pill for telling it like it is and speaking the plain truth.\\n\\nSide note: I think a lot of people would laugh at my view that being an Alpha provider is absolutely possible (being sexually exciting but also security/provision in a marriage) given that you find a girl who wants the Captain/First mate dynamics. I know I\\'m living my life on hard mode in a way (LTR and eventual marriage) but at the same time I\\'m gifted with the easy mode of being naturally high testosterone, 6\\' 3\" and athletic. ',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Ol’ Billy Redface and his Monday Morning Podcast were instrumental in helping me get through the roughest parts of my divorce with laughter and some general tough love (fat shaming and his “hit the gym when you get dumped” mantra).  But r/theredpill is what brought Lazarus back from the dead…\\n\\nHere is the story of how I found you ballsy fuckers.  \\n\\nA month and a half ago I was browsing r/all at work, as is my wont to do when I have a case of the Mondays and can’t bring myself to accomplish any, you know, *work*.  I was still in a depressive funk from my divorce but I had finally sold my house and moved back in with my parents so I wasn’t alone all the time anymore.  I still wasn’t going out, still had a black cloud hanging over me like Eeyore and still was addicted to fapping, poor eating and generally being a fat, negative, lazy homebody.\\n\\nThen I saw this post:\\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2fq5n5/a_whole_bunch_of_brilliant_posts_that_didnt_make/\\n\\nThe articles that jumped out to me immediately were “Don’t be like Bruce,” “Focus on you first. And second. And third. And...blah blah...Worry about women seventh” and “6 Harsh Truths That Will Make You a Better Person.”  These 3 posts hurt.  I mean damn. They hit me like a ton of bricks.  They made me realize I had been wallowing in a pit of depression so deep it would have been right at home in Buffalo Bill’s basement from Silence of the Lambs.  I literally was acting like a bitch.  Eating ice cream while crying.  Crying into my pillow.  Taking selfies of myself whilst crying to “remind myself” later about the pain.  Eeeeesh. Yuck.  My death was very likely going to “be like Bruce” if something didn’t change; I would probably have gotten over my ex-wife eventually, met another chick exactly like my ex-wife, married her, gotten dumped again…and eaten a bullet because I couldn’t believe it all happened again.  Not pretty.\\n\\nProbably the absolute lamest thing I did during this period was start to fantasize about my suicide.  I crafted this cockamamie narrative in my head where my death was “honorable” because “he choose to die for love” and “couldn’t go on without his queen.” I even drew a picture so gay I might just have to post it if enough of you demand it: I drew a picture of myself lying dead in my grave underground.  From my dead heart had sprung a root system that extended directly above myself until it broke the surface where it became a beautiful flower that brought a smile to my ex-wife’s face.   Even in death my Beta sacrifices would provide her with comfort and happiness [“The Oneitis is strong with this one”].  I drew it with a maniacal smile and a steady stream of tears running down my face. You know, cuz she would totally be standing around at my grave looking for flowers to sniff.  As Bill Burr would say, “OHHHHHHHHH JEEEZUSSSSSS.” I cringed writing that shit just now.  That is how far removed the Lazarus that sits here today is from the Lazarus that drew that faggy shit 3-4 months ago.\\n  \\nOne of the most bitter, painful red pill truths for me to swallow when I discovered you fellas was the fact that “Women do not love unconditionally, except for their children.”  I truly loved my wife unconditionally.  As a man reared in the pussy ass America we have had the last 40 years, I had been raised to believe in “the one” and unconditional love [Which is really a useful way of thinking when you are fat.   That “unconditional” word means I can get as fat as I want, right?]. I had grown up thinking the noblest sacrifice a man could ever make was giving his life for someone he loved.  …I know you guys will believe what I am about to write because a lot of you are like me, former Herbs.  I would have DIED for my wife. LITERALLY.  I would have stepped in front of a car for her.  I would have given her my vital organs.  I would have killed 10,000 people to save her life if that scenario ever unfolded somehow.  I meant it with every fiber of my being. It was a point of pride for me as a man.  I had put the pussy on a pedestal.  When I realized that the reasons my wife had fallen in love with me couldn’t be used to reignite her love for me, it was crushing.  I loved her as much at the end of our marriage as I did the first time I ever said “l love you” to her.  She could have gained 500 lbs., I would still have loved her (she was never a fatty and still looks amazing).  \\n\\nThe red pill taught me that as Men, our concepts of honor and loyalty are not the same as women’s.  Yeah women might use the same dictionary as us, they might quote the Male definition of those words in a classroom setting, but they do not KNOW what those things mean in the *exact* way Men do.  Anyone with a brother, homies, been in the military, hell pretty much every dude I know believes in some kind of code. Their personal moral and ethical barometer.  And that code includes many things like “your word is your bond”, “your friends are your brothers and you WILL BE THERE when they need you, no questions asked,”etc.   I am lucky to have always had a huge group of bros that truly are my BROTHERS; Men that are there for me through thick and thin and do not judge me.  I can go YEARS without seeing them and pick up like we last talked yesterday.  Women just aren’t like us.  They have no honor.  They have no loyalty.  They have only hypergamy.  Your pet dog is a better candidate for giving you unconditional love than a woman.  I will never forget this lesson.   \\n\\nThe other really painful red pill truth that I learned that day was “You cannot mandate desire.”  I had truly believed that I could use ultimatums to cure our dead bedroom.  “Have more sex with me or it’s over.  Be more attracted to me.” As my little brother told me in one of our many late night talks, “Dude, if you want to be desired…be desirable.” I had forgotten that.  I had gotten comfortable and gained probably 40 pounds over the 7 years I was with her.  I had stopped playing music, traded my weeknight bar gigs for COD co-op and became a useless couch potato.  Who finds that desirable?  Would you?\\nBut as I have learned from Rollo and Roissy, desire cannot be faked.  It can only exist when it is real.  It is drawn from raw emotion, not officially-stamped marriage paperwork or years of “being together.”  Passion is harder and harder to keep alive as time goes on, which is why cheating is so popular [Guess what? This Betaboy had also been raised to believe “a *real man* doesn’t cheat”].  I realized instantaneously that what I had been doing with my wife by feebly asking for sex at the end had sped up my divorce, not slowed it down.  I was trying to defuse a bomb but I cut the wrong wire and the timer just sped up.   \\n\\nThere was a time when she just couldn’t wait any longer and would blow me in public places.  When road head was something that happened because she *needed* my dick in her mouth, STAT.  At the end, there was no excitement, no sense of danger or even a rush.  It was just mechanical “this will shut him up” sex.  I feel terrible now knowing that I forced my wife to have sex when she wasn’t into it.  Because who wants to feel like “let’s just get it over with” regarding something as mind-blowingly awesome as sex?   \\n\\nSince finding that treasure trove post, I have devoured the rest of the articles in that link and found my way to Rational Male (Rollo), Chateau Heartiste (Roissy), Roosh’s website, KrauserPUA, Tyler from RSD and many others.  I am a voracious reader when I find a subject that fascinates me.  I have now read over 100 articles/posts on Rational male and Roissys site (the 2007-2009 Roissy posts are the best ones he ever did, IMO.  Everything by Rollo is enlightening).  Of those, I have probably re-read about 40 that were really useful. \\n \\nSuffice to say I had no idea that a community of bad motherfuckers like this existed on reddit.  I usually just checked out r/CODZombies, r/milf and the general Internet detritus that accumulates on the front page.  I am spreading the word everywhere I go now about the red pill.  But I have to temper myself by remembering that not every Man is ready to be unplugged at this exact moment.  Until then I will just be an example of someone they noticed is “changing.”  \\n\\nMy gym and diet are going great; I have lost 40 lbs. since June.  My confidence is much improved; I faked it until the confidence became real.  This WORKS.   My game is getting better; I have banged 7 chicks over the last 2 months and I don’t give a fuck about walking into the hen house like a lone wolf (solo cold approaching a table full of disinterested looking chicas).  My social life is busy as fuck; I literally don’t have to try to not watch TV or play video games because I am too busy.  I am getting better at sex due to less fapping and massive testosterone from exercising 2x daily; I last longer and the girls are busting more frequently.  Most importantly I think, I moved out my parents’ house and into a sick ass bachelor pad, Workaholics-style.  Our pad straight looks like the Delta’s house in Animal House, dripping with scummy masculinity (the best kind!). \\n\\nBecause of the red pill sub and my bros, this proverbial Stella got his groove back and is out there killing it.  But I know my journey isn’t over; it’s just beginning. I didn’t write this to drop some knowledge like a learned doctor.  I wrote this as a genuine thank you and hopefully, as inspiration to the next man who discovers the red pill and goes on the ride of his life.  Cuz in the end, that’s all the red pill really advocates. Be the best man you can be, according to YOUR definition of what constitutes a man.  Fuck morality, fuck religious/political wrangling over our responsibility to be “good men.” My only responsibility is to own everyday like a Boss.  Cuz when you own the world, you’re always home (great Queens of the Stone Age lyric, haha).\\n\\nCrucial thanks to my buddies who have shared their time and energy getting me back on my feet, crucial thanks to the PUA/Red pill community for amassing years of written research and field work.  And crucial thanks to anyone who reads this and finds it useful.  I hope to someday be like a Roissy or Rollo to the next generation.  We need as many as we can find, because Gentlemen…this is war. \\n\\nBecause of Brotherhood, because of Men looking out for other Men, I am now a proud member of the “fucked 2 chicks in 1 day” club. My confidence is so thick you could bottle it and sell it as a steak sauce.  And Brothers….I’m just getting warmed up… \\n\\nRemember: DON’T BE LIKE BRUCE\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Guys, this shit is saving my marriage. \\n\\nI\\'ve always had some natural game, but after i got married I acted wrong and my relationship went down the tubes. \\n\\nYou know how I fucked up my marriage? By genuinely trying to be a really nice guy. The nicest, most romantic, hardest working husband and gentle father in the world. I sacrificed so much of myself for my wife because I thought it was the right thing to do, and I got fuck all for it.  I was told, and believed, this is what women want, and this is how you act as a good husband. \\n\\nPredictably, my wife lost interest in me. I \"stepped up my game\" and acted even more beta. She grew to despise me. I eventually became submissive. I became scared. I hated my marriage, my life, my self, and her. I came very close to leaving a few times but I couldn\\'t - because of my son and the legal climate we exist in now. \\n\\nI began slowly digesting the red pill last month, and now I\\'ve put it into action. The results have been nothing short of amazing. It\\'s a total revelation to me. \\n\\nI call my wife on all her shit now. She\\'s happier every single day. If she starts a fight, I end it like a man. She\\'s calmer now. I demand satisfaction in bed. She is performing willingly for the first time in months. I lead her, and she submits to me. I focus on my mission, and she focuses on me. I\\'m working out every day now. I feel strong again. I\\'m improving in every aspect of my life. My son has a strong male role model. \\n\\nTo me, the most important change is that I\\'m progressing as a man. Being a leader. Being dominant. Making the decisions. Being courageous. THIS IS WHAT I WAS PUT ON EARTH TO BECOME. I am becoming a great man and I love it. My power is growing and I love it. I am rock solid. I am a man. \\n\\nI am a man. Finally. \\n\\nSo, thanks to this community for your wisdom. It\\'s benefited my life, along with my wife\\'s and my son\\'s too. I will give my son the knowledge and example to be a strong man. I have shared this site with some real life friends. TRP cannot be ignored - truth shines. \\n\\nEdit: posted a longer, more detailed story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/marriedredpill/comments/2ivb9v/how_i_took_back_my_marriage/) in /r/marriedredpill ',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hello. My name is Lazarus.  I have been a red pill reader for over 1 month now.  My experience is not unique but I will still provide a backstory at some point down the road.  The one sentence version of what brought me to the red pill is “natural alpha met dream girl and settled down, gradually became beta, wife lost interest, tried everything society had taught me to save marriage, still ended up divorced and broken.” (Ok so it’s a long sentence, fuck you)\\n\\nThis post and all future posts are dedicated to Men everywhere. My Brothers, YOU are the only reason I didn’t end my life, the only reason I kept going when I truly felt like it was pointless.  Now I am unstoppable, a force of nature around women and men, the funnest motherfucker you will ever have the pleasure of partying with…all because my boys wouldn’t let me throw in the towel.  And let’s not forget the Men who are total strangers to me yet still have helped me grow so much (BILL FUCKING BURR, Roissy, Rollo Tomassi, Roosh, Mystery, Tony, countless others).  I now have a vastly deeper understanding of myself, other men, and women.  More importantly, I reframed my priorities so that I am always working toward creating the best Lazarus, not just a Lazarus that can get laid.  \\n\\nI can never repay the gifts given to me by my brothers…so I will make it my work to pick up the mantle and spread the gospel of red pill.  My buddies who I have introduced to the red pill are already seeing a benefit in their relationships/marriages (hell even work shit with their male bosses); my single buddies are getting more pussy.  This shit is REAL.  But it isn’t a shortcut.  In fact, if you really read the shit that these wicked smaat fuckers are spitting, you will realize that the main reason most dudes are not Alpha is because it is fucking WORK to be alpha.  It is easy as fuck to be beta.  Even “natural” alphas don’t have it as easy as you would like to believe.  Nothing in life is free, and if it is, guess what? You won’t appreciate it since it didn’t require any effort to obtain.  \\n\\nI know the red pill is real because I have found myself, my ex-wife and situations I lived through/created in myriad examples of red pill literature.  Neither Men nor Women are unique snowflakes.  We need to remember that Men created order in this world and we are the only ones who can run it efficiently.  Sadly, I truly believe if I had discovered the red pill 1 year ago, I could have saved my marriage.  But it doesn’t matter now – it doesn’t make me feel any sense of regret.  My life is my journey alone, not my ex-wife’s, not my friends’ and not my parents. Mine.  So here we go...\\n\\nBill Burr is a Stand Up Man\\n\\nBill Burr is a stand-up comedian.  He is very funny, talks about what it’s like being an average guy and is generally the type of comedian that has a mostly male audience, like Joe Rogan.   But Mr. Burr is very unique.  He has a podcast, “The Monday Morning Podcast” which frankly is one of the most unique and interesting podcasts out there in my opinion.   The format is simple: Bill, by himself, rambles on about what is going on in his life: where he recently traveled to do standup, hockey/football games he watched, anecdotes about what is going on in his life, etc.  What is unique about Mr. Burr is that he doesn’t give a fuck.  Not one flying fuck. His sign off to his audience at the end of his show is “Go fuck yourselves.”  Now he may be “joking” but I don’t think he is in some ways.  Bill Burr does not give one flying fuck if you listen to his podcast.  He doesn’t care if you like it or hate it.  Why? Because Mr. Burr doesn’t make the podcast for you or me.  Bill Burr does his weekly podcast for 1 person: Bill Burr.\\n\\nThink about it: He is very famous, he was on Breaking Bad and since then his star is rising and he is truly in his prime, comedy-wise (he\\'s been doing stand up for 20+ years, he can kill anywhere, I have seen it).  Why would he take a hour out of his awesome life every week to talk to a bunch of strangers?  It ain’t web-revenue dynamics or some other $5 word.  Its dedication.  It’s a Cal Ripkin-like work ethic.  Bill Burr’s only real occasional guest is his wife, the Lovely Nia.  Nia sometimes helps Bill answer questions from listeners, especially if the question is about women/dating.  Nia is honestly a bad bitch.  She is a hot-as-fuck black girl, with a smoky, sultry voice and you can tell by how she talks that she is a HB9-10.  Google that shit if you don’t believe.  Now I love me some Bill Burr. But Bill Burr is a short, balding ginger.  How does such a man pull a hot as fuck black girl?  You would probably say, “Duh! He is rich and famous, he is on tv.”  Nope.  Listen to their interactions.  Mr. Burr gives Nia ‘gina tingles.  All the fucking time.  You can practically hear them.  How does he accomplish this? By kissing her ass?  By agreeing with her? Nope! By calling her on her shit, arguing with her, teasing/taunting her, displaying amused mastery and most importantly, by being willing to literally KICK HER OFF the show when he doesn’t need her anymore or disagrees with her.  Most men wouldn’t be willing to kick their chick off their own podcast if they live with that person.  But Bill doesn’t give a fuck. \\n\\nOther reasons to love Bill Burr:\\n\\n1.\\tBill Burr is a fan of fat shaming.  Listen to his podcasts where he talks about how disgusting and sickening he finds fat men and women to be.  If you are at all like me, after listening to a few of his podcasts, you start to respect and agree with this very honest and funny man.  Because of the 1-man format of the show, you start to feel like a buddy is at your house and he is telling stories or you are having a (albeit 1-sided) interesting conversation.  So when someone you think is funny and interesting and whose opinion you respect starts talking shit on YOUR eating habits and YOUR exercise habits, it is a lot more effective than you can imagine.  When your wife/girlfriend/mom tell you that you need to eat better or hit the gym, you will automatically get defensive.  But when Bill Burr does it, for some reason it really hits home and makes me think he is right. \\n2.\\tBill Burr isn’t a company man.  Half the time Bill can’t read the advertising on his show because he is borderline illiterate (which makes for some very funny moments).  But Bill also calls out his sponsors when they give him shitty copy to read, or ask him to lie/make up a BS story that will help move units.  Bill will literally call these fuckers out and say “don’t buy this shit, even though I just got paid to sell it to you and I am going to lose this sponsor tomorrow.”  The advertising he does offer is all directed to his listeners, as he perceives them.  As a result, he advertises bbq grill grates, shaving razor blades, gifts for mother’s day and other shit you were probably gonna buy anyway as a man.  \\n3.\\tBill Burr is PURE ALPHA.  During my recent divorce, I relied on Bill’s podcasts to get me through some tough times with laughter.  After I listened to all of the ones there are available on his website (http://www.billburr.com/podcast), I went on youtube and hunted down the first 3 years of podcasts, which he used to post weekly to his Myspace page back when myspace was a thing.  The quality is shit in a very sweet, DIY way.  Bill was using a cell phone to record them.  It was mostly just him talking about his tour dates at first.  Sometimes he accidentally deleted them and he would just post a 30 second version explaining he fucked up and deleted it so no podcast this week.  The end would always cut off.  But then a funny thing happened: He started to interact with his listeners by answering their questions.  But he didn’t do it like you would expect – cherry pick the best questions, give detailed answers that made Bill look great – instead he routinely called out his listeners for their boring, shitty questions and often gave answers that showed Bill getting his ass handed to him, embarrassed or something that gave you an insight into how he became the man he is today.  He pushes his listeners by inspiring them with pep talks and what his experience has shown him to be true.  The most Alpha thing I ever heard in my life, which left me with a perpetual smile for a day was this: A early episode of the Monday Morning Podcast in which Bill states to the listener that he is going to pack up his life and move from New York to Los Angeles and try to get into acting.  At the moment he recorded this, you can tell by his vocal tone and word choices that he is not certain that he going to make it in Hollywood.  He has hit the wall in New York and if he doesn’t move to LA, he will likely stagnate.  He sounds like a mixture of excitement, apprehension and fear as he describes the unknown voyage ahead of him.  As I sat there listening, I couldn’t help but think of the amazing job he did on Breaking Bad, his great supporting parts in films that are happening more frequently and how he just got married to Nia, who was barely a girlfriend at that point in time.  Bill Burr is my fucking hero because the same Bill Burr who didn’t know if he was going to make it in Hollywood is the Bill Burr who IS making it in Hollywood!\\n4.\\tBill Burr is one of the last “old school” men.  If you listen to his podcast a few times, you will know exactly what I mean.  We all have uncles and grandpa’s that talk and think like Bill, but the pussification of this country over the last 40 years cannot be illustrated better than by listening to Bill’s podcast and then immediately listening to something like \"the Nerdist\" or \"You made it Weird\", podcasts run by Beta boys. \\n5.\\tBill Burr believes in Brotherhood.  Patrice O’Neal, rest his soul was one of Bill’s best friends.  Seek out the episodes where he talks about Patrice, even some Opie and Anthony episodes.  The amount of emotion Bill felt for the loss of Patrice is palpable.  And now every year Bill and a bunch of Patrice’s best friends get together to do a benefit to put money in the pockets of Patrice’s mother and widow.  Pure class.  Listen to any Monday Morning podcast episode with Joe Bartnick, Joe DeRosa, Paul Virzi or Jason Lawhead. You can HEAR the brotherhood in how they interact.  \\n6.\\tBill Burr is one of the reasons I am alive.  I don’t know if he will ever read this, but I was at the lowest point of my divorce and all I could think about was checking out.  Every time the silence of the night or the noticeable emptiness of my giant bed would call me to think dark thoughts, I would turn on a random episode of the Monday Morning podcast.  And I would fall asleep laughing to the sound of one of my favorite people.  Thank you Bill.  I got to shake your hand once at the Brea Improv.  That was enough.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I was looking for a succinct title. Frankly, this isn\\'t the best that I can come up with but will suffice.\\n\\nBefore TRP... No, way before TRP I was one of those guys who believed in the \"one right girl for you\" bullshit along with the other socially acceptable fairy tales like \"friendship\" and \"follow your passion and be good at what you\\'re doing and that will be enough\". I was the guy who had unrequited love with a girl that never was anything more to her other than a validator/beta orbiter to the point of sulking every night all alone listening to shitty (to my newfound standards) music and hanged around other beta orbiters who were also disappointed for more or less the same reasons.\\n\\nMy quest to interpret female behavior led me to embrace reality as is. It almost feels like the plot twists in the movies where the main character finds a treasure chest only to open it and release a curse upon the world instead of living happily ever after. Only in my case I didn\\'t released anything; I merely was able to see more clearly what was already there. I only wish I had found TRP sooner, at least 4 years sooner. That would definitely save both my face and my mind from delving into the dark thoughts of ending my life. \\n\\nBefore I felt like a burden, unwanted to everyone. Now I realize that everyone, myself included, can only talk or want someone around only when they have something to get from him, even if that\\'s something is merely company and thought-provoking discussions. I realize that there will never be a girl who will just \"love me for who I am\" and I have to work hard to improve myself. I realize that making sparks when you type code in the computer is not enough to be a top programmer and that you need to play the game of politics and social networking in order to be visible to the right person at the right time. \\n\\nI realized that the moment I was born a man my game of life is set on hard mode. By reading suggested TRP books like \"no more mr. nice guy\" and \"48 laws of power\" I enriched my theoretical knowledge and I still have a long way to go.\\n\\nIn a year or 2 from now I want to post in TRP with my progress but, I want to be fair: Being alive and out of my darker days ready to engage the world is progress enough for someone who was considering to kill himself feeling like a victim who wondered what has he ever done to deserve so much pain. \\n\\nThank you for reading.',\n",

I did end up fucking her quite a few times, but I still felt like she as just kind of doing me the favor and she knew it, not the other way around.

       "  'selftext': 'Big time lurker here, but I wanted to say thank you to TRP and thought sharing my story might help those who are/were in a similar spot. Might be kinda long, but hopefully worth the read and insightful.\\n\\nI discovered TRP probably a year ago, no surprise I found it because someone had called it evil or hateful or some such nonsense in an askreddit thread. I read the sidebar, started devouring the top posts, and reading any literature I could get my hands on. It was a real eye opener, yet I wasn\\'t ready to swallow. I had the typical NAWALT or I\\'m searching for a unicorn mentality. Consequently, my life did not improve and I languished with depression, loneliness, and an internal 24/7 pity party for myself.\\n\\nNow just a little background on my situation as it was. I\\'m 32, no kids, about 5\\'10\" and weighing around 190 lbs. I have a steady job and my own place, I ain\\'t rich by any means. Anyway, I guess I could say I have had moderate success with women before TRP (if we\\'re basing it simply on sticking my dick in girls). Thing was, it never worked out, and looking back much of my teens and 20\\'s were spent as a cringe worthy beta filled with jealousy of those guys who \"always got the girl\". I always dated down and settled for the scraps.\\n\\nIt all changed this past March. I made the stupid and unforgivable mistake of getting behind the wheel after drinking. I was pulled over, arrested, spent the night and next day in county jail. To be brief, the system had it\\'s way with me, and I did get off easier than some do for the same offense. I think it was this event that provided illumination for taking control of my life in a positive way.\\n\\nWith no license for a year, and having substantial fines to pay, it pretty much forced me into monk mode. I came back and re-read TRP, swallowed it, digested it. I took the principles and tailored them to the strengths of my personality. I started going for a daily walk, which soon turned into a daily jog, which soon turned into a morning jog and an evening jog. I started light lifting with nothing more than a couple empty milk jugs filled with sand. I started doing push ups and crunches every morning as well. Soon enough, I got over the stigma of being self conscious and started taking full advantage of the fitness center in my apartment complex. \\n\\nI embraced the abundance mentality. I learned to smile more. I started saying hello to everyone, making eye contact, acting interested in girls I would never have approached before because of my own insecurities. I took up a new hobby and discovered I love to paint even though I\\'m no Picasso. \\n\\nI stopped making excuses for myself and owned my failures and successes. People around me could see that I valued myself more than I ever did in the past and it becomes contagious. It inspires those around you to try to better themselves. I took pussy off the pedestal and you know, started talking to girls like they are fucking human beings who are also flawed, just like me. My life has done a 180 and now I get approached by girls, people look to me for insight and guidance,  I\\'m more in control than I\\'ve ever been. Just wanted to say thank you TRP, you changed my life, maybe even saved it! TRP should be required reading for all men who are depressed and unhappy with their station in life. ',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I've been reading TRP for about 5 months now and i have seen the difference in how people treat me and approach me ever since. \\n\\nI recently took up a part time job as a waiter to earn gas money for school. In hindsight that was a bad idea, i felt there was more money to be made, but that's another post for another sub, . Anyways i learned from my co-workers that my boss, the owner, was a complete dick to anyone who screwed up the slightest thing. Having worked a couple jobs with ass-hole bosses my typical (beta) reaction to them was to just agree and take the abuse. But last week i messed up an order and my boss started going off on me. Instead of going into beta mode and telling him that i was sorry and it won't happen again, I waited until he was done and told him how it was. I explained to him that i get scheduled 2 days a week and after only working for three weeks I've barley had time to learn everything and that I'm going to make mistakes. Basically I let him know that he was being an irrational prick without saying those words exactly. After i finished i walked away and nothing was said about it afterwards. Today HE messed by making an order wrong after i told him what the customer wanted. One of the girls i was working with basically told me that he was pissed about it and to be ready for it. I walked up to the window to talk to him and even though he still blamed it on me, he didn't go off. He told me to be more clear next time and left it at that. Although that still irritated me that he didn't take responsibility i feel that is a step up from what he usually does. He respected me as a man and took partial responsibility for what went wrong. If I hadn't discovered TRP he would have went off on me today and i would have just taken it like a little bitch. But instead i held frame and stood my ground. Thank you RP and all its contributors, you have turned me from a boy into a man.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Intro:\\nI’ve transferred to a large party school last year, but I’ve been in monk mode ever since.  At the beginning of my junior year, I went to an Asian frat party and was consequently rejected by three girls in a row.  I felt ashamed and down about myself and went back to my dorm to sleep off my buzz.  After this, I went over the situation countless times to find out I did not know what I did wrong: I tried to be funny, to connect with them but after a while the girls would run off and I never knew why.\\n\\nBEFORE\\n\\nAppearances:\\n I knew that looks mattered but I never knew that it would be so important while picking up girls.  I was a 5’ 10’’ Asian dude at 190 lbs so I was a bit chubby and had love handles only a teapot could love.  I also never had braces so my front teeth protrude out, but my smile is straight in pictures.  When I talk to people, they always look at my teeth and then cover their own, especially girls that I was trying to hit on.  Therefore, I had low self esteem about my teeth.  \\n\\nMindset:  \\nI was getting depressed about leaving all of my friends in St. Louis, so I started to get into reddit more and more.  In my first two years at my other school, I was only interested in one Korean girl who I had a relationship with but got super lazy and fat due to my constant supply of pussy.  I had a severe case of one-itis and thought that she was my unicorn.  I was always trying to get her approval, but she eventually dumped me because of my perceived beta-ness.  Her shit-tests worked and I responded in the worst way possible. Hindsight is 20/20.  \\nI grew up as a pastor’s son and was taught to be extremely nice and complacent to everyone.  Church did teach me empathy, but failed to teach me about the real fucking world.  Jesus is fucking awesome, but he did not have to deal with today’s bitches.\\n\\n\\n\\nAFTER\\n\\nAppearances: \\nNow I know that appearances do matter.  I know my teeth weren’t fixed by braces and that everyone is a fucking bracist.  When I speak and don’t reveal my own teeth but only when I’m smiling or laughing.  Otherwise, I never give validation to anyone else.  I dress appropriately and don’t give a shit.  I stand up straight and look people in the eye when I’m approaching them.  Our school has buses and now I find myself sitting straighter than anyone else.  I don’t look down at my iphone to avoid looking at people. I give people the wild wolf look- with narrowed eyes which is pretty easy for me.  I leave a 5 o’ clock shadow on my face to let people know I can cut their shit with my semi beard.  \\nI am a 21 year old man, and I deserve some goddamn respect.  Who else can I respect if I can’t respect myself.  I now shoot hoops and run in the morning as well as lift.  I am now 168 lbs with decent musculature.  I now see more and more girls glance at me since I am taller than the average Asian dude and is actually not skinny or underweight.   \\n\\nMindset:\\nNo one cares about me except my parents and sister.  There are so many attractive females walking around campus, yet all of them ride the CC.  Even my roommate, who is a 6’ 3’’ lifting junkie cannot get a single lay.  These girls know that there is always someone better than me, faster than me, smarter than me, better looking than me- and so they won’t even give me the time of day.  I now know that there is nothing else I want more in life is to become a dentist- make 500k a year, drive a fucking Mercedes, and own a big house with bitches.  \\nI am now in monk mode- I could care less about anyone else.  Why would I care about what a 120 lb girl thinks or does?  I could fucking bodyslam her and incapacitate her for days.  I live in the fucking library studying for the DATs.  I don’t party hardcore anymore.  All these girls are dating fucking losers because they’re more fun.  I now know that when I become a dentist, I will know that these girls who ride the carousal will only date me in the fucking future  because I am husband material.  \\n\\n\\nAdvice:  If you were a groveling Asian dude like me who was hung up on one girl, fucking go monk mode.  Being by myself has taught me a lot about myself.  I have relied on myself more and more, eaten by myself, and have gotten a confidence boost. I see whipped guys with hot girls and realize that the poor dude was me three years ago.  Thank the Red pill for teaching me to improve myself, give myself goals, get stronger, and to find out \\n\\nTL:DR Red pill has taught me to disregard females: acquire goals.\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I met an old friend at a party a week ago. When he asked me how I was doing, he was surprised to here my honest and sincere answer:\"I\\'m really great, everything is going just as I want it to.\" He expressed his surprise, because he had followed my struggle through my 20s, and topped this of by saying:\"You were the archetype of a angry young man with no answers and it\\'s good to see you on track.\" This coming from a natural alpha kinda made me feel really good about my past year accomplishments and my search for answers to the following questions:\\n\\n\"How could she do this to me?\" - \"Why is this happening to me?\" - \"Why can\\'t she love me the way I am?\" Sound familiar? Yeah, I\\'ve been asking these questions a lot back in my blue pill days. But the most glaring question stuck with me:\"Why am I so angry?\"\\nI was taught, from a young age, that you put women on a pedestal, you suffer and sacrifice for your woman, you defend her and take care of her, you have to be kind and gentle and listen to her needs and wants and in the end she will reward you with unconditional love and appreciation, right? \\nHell no! Recognizing that all my conditioned behavior did not lead to success, in the contrary, leading me to get hurt and be abandoned made me so angry. \\nInspite everthing I was taught I learned that women can be selfish and skittish, they will make you suffer for every weakness you show, they will undermine your integrity if you let them and try to cut you off from your family and friends to isolate you, and the best part about all this is: it\\'s always your fault.\\nI\\'m not being sarcastic here, I sincerely mean it: it\\'s always our fault. \\n\\nI had to learn this the hard way, but I did.\\n\\nWhen I started out looking for answers, I was going through a terrible break up. And man, was I angry. Probably the first thing that helped me was finding this quote:\\n\"Being angry at someone is as though picking up a burning coal to throw it at someone; you\\'re the one who gets burnt.\"\\nSo I started letting go. All her hypergamy, her solipsism, her malice towards me, it stopped mattering to me. \\nWhat started mattering again was my own contentment and my improvement as a human being. I picked up making music again, I went back to training martial arts and started looking for meaningless hook ups instead of trying to find my soulmate.\\nI would sometimes have a hiccup and fall back into beta behavior, but after some research and finding people like Rollo Tomassi, Roosh, Dalrock, The Beige Phillip Show and The Red Pill community I would always have a light house to guide me through treacherous passages and get back on track.\\nMy success story is not one of one shining inscident or a load of hook ups, it\\'s more of a slow climb up a steep mountain. By now, I have released an album with my band and am involved in several other projects as well, I\\'m an instructor at my gym and teach other people something I enjoy more than anything and am on the verge of making a huge jump in my professional working field. \\nOn top I found a young woman, after spinning plates for a while who I thought was worthy of my attention and who I have let into my life. \\n\\nI probably still have a long way to go, but I really want to thank this community and everyone who is involved in the manosphere for shining a bright light on the truth of gender behavior and for not watering down your believes to accommodate feminine imperative.\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'This is not a story about me and my prowess on the sexual market, nor a rant about women and feminism. This is simply a tale regarding me, my dad, my mom and her boss.\\n\\nTo start out with I\\'ll have to admit that I\\'m supprised I was ever born, my dad (god bless his soul) is just as autistic as I, which as a standpoint, is not a very good sign. The story behind how my mom and dad got together is that my dad was working at a bar, and my mom and her BFF made a bet that my mom could totally pick up that bartender, my dad was suprisingly very /fit/ in his youth. The bet was an expensive liquir of some sort. Which was worth very much since my mom was still studying.\\n\\nThey got together, my mom moved in with my dad, since my mom was still studying while my dad was working. Mom get\\'s a job, they get married after my mom got prego with my bigbro. They get married, my mom have a hard time with her job, and get\\'s a new one, in which she have to move up the foodchain again, after around 2 she get\\'s prego with me. (very dependent on my dad 3-4 after the birth of my big bro basicly.) \\n\\nThings were good and well until my dad got into a sport accident and fucked up his back. (My dad have always had a bad back, both geneticly and because he spend most of his youth working at somekind of heavy lifting job in the industrial area.) He stops working out, and he gets curvy by time. (not exactly fat untill much later.)\\n\\nWhen I was around 5, my mom became \\'very good friends\\' with her boss, and so we had to eat dinner with him and his family. (had to become friends with boss step son + daughter n all that shit, note that at that age, I would crawl under my moms chair and cry if there were too many people in the room that I didn\\'t know, so you could speculate that I might not be the best at making friends, especially being forced to be so. But I digress. \\n\\nMy dad might have been dangerously autistic like me, but apparently we\\'re apparently so retarded that the hamsterwheel won\\'t even turn on us, and we had a hardtime dealing with bullshit, first of all we can\\'t distingus it from lies and truth, and we couldn\\'t create it, so we\\'re kind of unfiltered, and in general don\\'t really give a fuck about our behaviour and what we say. Which is kind of a gift in here I suppose, and he called my mom on her bullshit. My mom said that he was just jealous and that was that. My dad clapped his hands and said welp, nothing to do here. And simply left it at that without anymore proof. \\n\\nBy the time I was 13-14 the atmosphere in the dinningroom was more gloomy then a graveyard, and I got addicted to my computer, barely did anything \\'cept playing CS, Unreal, and worms. My /fit/ stats were around 84 kilos and 170~ centimeters tall. I was a fat piece of shit. \\n\\nGot into this skiing accident, broken jaw, loss of teeth, concussion, bent ribs. It was ugly. had to eat through a straw, but I loss weight thou.\\n\\nAt the end of first Highschool/gymnasium I was 1.85, 72 kilos. Looked better then I had in years, selfasteem through the roof, got a GF even though I have been in special Ed classes most of my life, got through this student exchange shit and I got fucking laid, kissed 2 girls at once, didn\\'t give a single fuck. Apparenly they liked obnoxious fuckheads with borat refrences in southeren europe. That was untill my dad broke up with my mom.\\n\\nIn the beginning, he and she didn\\'t really give an explination, the guess was that they simply got tired of each other, but in reality my dad kind of still loved my mom or something, because when I was going to our vication house with the bosses sons and daughter, and just before I arrived my mom called me and said that \"btw, me and boss man is my bf now.\" \\n\\nApparently after my mom slowly stopped holding my dads hand, kissing him etc. My dad had searched her phone and found some intresting texts to boss-man. My dad have always been the always-look-on-the-brightside kinda guy so he simply said that moms love for boss-man was simply grown stronger, though he was still \\'disapointed\\' that she didn\\'t love me and my brother enough to still her needs. \\nkey word is disapointed. \\nMy dad have shared cigars and drinks, cheered with beer and wine, been with Boss-man since I was fucking 5. And he had been screwing his wife for at least 10 years, fucked up their marrige, got them out on this huge fight on who should get what, and sell this huge house while the economy was shit and nobody wanted to buy it because they didn\\'t want to live together, but nobody had the money to live alone in it. I would atleast ask the guy if he wanted to pull the knife out of my back, if not taking a hockymask on and beat the living shit out of that fucker. but again, I digress.\\n\\n1-2 years later, got introduced to the game, mystery method, and things kinda excalated from there and at somepoint I got to TRP.\\n\\nI must admit, before, and sometime after TRP, I hated when women shit-tested me, if maybe not women in general. I was the guy who yelled \\'smack my bitch up\\' the loudest when the prodigy was playing. I didn\\'t take it as a test, and that I should take it as a compliment that the women was testing me to see if I was worthy of their wet panties, but no matter how many times people said that in books, the internet or other places. That shit was just a fucking insult. I\\'m not my fucking dad you fucking whore! I know that\\'s what I think, but I can\\'t seem to shake it off me, and I got into this weird mix of being horny, but didn\\'t take shit from women, which neither they nor me could figur out, untill I learned about frames, which helped me not to not get mad at women, but to channel my rage of a thousand burning suns hatefull fury into a simpel body language that told women (and wiseguys) not to talk shit like that. \\n\\nyear after that, 84 kilos, 190 cm 15~% fat. Though I have never even tried to get a GF/LTR (even though that seems to be the basic contract you have to sign before being handed the pussy here in Denmark.) As the moment I get any shit-test at all I completly shut them down, not even trying to get though the shit-test I fucking shame the bitches in a country where having another oppinion then the women will shutdown the hose from under the curtains (Just ask roosh.) But when I found out that only foreigners use OKcupid I have gotten lots of results since they haven\\'t been brainwashed with Jantelaw and other feminist bullshit. Thank the fucking gods above for fucking foreigners, I simply can\\'t seem to comprehend why muricans got so much against them. I would rather cut my wrists then talk to a danish woman about anything for more then 10 minutes about anything if the means was to get my dick wet. 0 Charm, 0 fasionsense, not being able to flirt, more tightassed then a fucking nun, but worse at sex. I swear when I become an engineer I\\'ll get the fuck outta dodge, move to southamerica or something. but I digress for the last time in my short story.\\n\\nTRP, I\\'m taking off my hat and everyone with me, in the small time bar called masculinity that we call home, raises a glass and chant your name in unison. \\n\\nThank you, thank you so much.

       "  'selftext': \"Deep down inside I always knew what many of trp principles were, even before they were labelled as redpill. I was already familiar with truisms like AFBB, I just had no clue how pervasive it was. I also had no clue on how to implement red pill principles and theories or philosophy of how and why they worked. Because of this sub I've been able to more coherently put the pieces together and wanted to take time out to thank this sub for pointing me in the right direction.\\n\\nI've never had much of a problem attracting the attention of women I suppose. My problem was not getting to fuck them on a regular basis. More times than not I'd find myself in the friend zone. By the time I got to college it began to eat away at my self worth.\\n\\nTo be fair, I sure as hell don't have super model looks and have never been a pretty boy. However, I played football and was also captain of the wrestling team so on the outside I appeared to be the typical alpha jock. On the inside though, I was beta as fuck. \\n\\nI'm embarrassed thinking back on how I used to bend over backwards for chicks in an effort to be the nice guy. Once I got a girl's attention I figured being respectful and treating them like a human being was the way to keep it. Even though I knew better, I tricked myself into thinking that buying women drinks at the bar would help me get my foot in the door. Hell, I've even helped a chick move into her apartment with the hope of getting to fuck afterwards (I'm sure you all know how that turned out).\\n\\nIn fact, looking back I think helping that one chick move was my rock bottom. Believe me, I was more upset at myself than I was at her. Deep down inside my fucked up blue pill mind, I knew she was using me like an orbiter. But like most blue pillers, I thought that helping her out when she had no place else to turn would put me over the top. I guess it did sort of put me over the top, just not in the way I intended. Instead it helped me get my head out of my ass and get some of my fucking dignity back. This is where trp comes in.\\n\\nLike I said before, I was always seen as alpha on the outside. Hitting the weights wasn't a problem, I did that just about everyday anyway. My style could always use improvement but it's never been a major issue. I've got a decent job that most chicks find interesting (scientist). But what I really needed trp for was to clean up my interactions with women. I needed some real life insight to keep myself from doing the things that would land me in the friend zone. Identifying things like oneitis, AWALT, maintaining frame and passing shit tests have been invaluable to me. Focusing on me rather than trying to appeal to women is probably the most important philosophy I've taken from the sub.\\n\\nBeing able to hear all of the anecdotal evidence of how you guys apply trp tactics along with the effect it's had on your interactions with women has also helped me immensely. I realize that many of the stories here are most likely bullshit, but I can easily incorporate the parts that I know would help me out. At any rate I just wanted to send out my thanks to this sub. Ten years ago I doubt my thick skull would have allowed the finer details of trp to sink in. Now that I witness it everyday, it more than makes sense. \\n\\n I have so many more embarrassing betafied stories as well as some of how trp has improved my life in general. But I'll end it here and save those for another time.\",\n",

In my culture it\\'s very common to bend to our parents wishes and be good little\"ethnic\" boys and girls...  My career path was decided on my parents wims, so was the house i bought...  Every time i wanted to do something and my parents said \"No, do this instead\" I complied...\\n\\nI\\'ve always wanted a motorcycle and my parents both said \"No!\", \"youll kill yourself\" \"it\\'ll kill us every time you\\'re out on it, they so dangerous, do you want to put us in an early grave\"  \"no good \\'ethnic\\' kid would ride a bike\"  \"why do you want a bike to be macho american man\" and all sorts of other crap.  I am a 1st gen US born.  I took my rider safety class 7 years ago to show them i was serious and would to be as safe as possible about it, and i still let them push me around and tell me \"No\" even though i was 23 and making my own money at that time.  \\n\\nFinally I\\'m 30 now... you know what, enough bullshit, screw this, I\\'m a fucking adult, I have to stand up to my parents if I\\'m ever going to stand up to anybody...  I have to make my own decisions and do what I want, do things that will make me happy.  How can I lead if i\\'m still tuck tail every time I\\'m dictated to by my parents.  \\n\\nSo I said fuck it and bought an old small harley and retook the riders course.  I never even told them, they just saw it when they came over to my house a few days later.  There was a lot of screaming by my parents that I normally would have engaged in, but engaging means you\\'ve already lost.  Mom didn\\'t talk to me for 2 weeks... Dad was reasonable, I don\\'t like it, but there\\'s nothing I can do he\\'s an adult.  That changed after my mom started blaming him because she got on my dad\\'s ass for \"being ok with it\" and \"encouraging me\" even though he was just being a realist.\\n\\nMy whole family, extended too, has tried every way imaginable to get me to sell it, first treating me like a child \"you will sell this bike, you can\\'t have it\", then guilt \"you\\'re killing your parents\" \"what do you need to prove\", then reason \"they\\'re not safe, it\\'s not you we\\'re worried about it\\'s other drivers\".  I deflected all of it.  I hear them talk shit when they think i\\'m not listening, but fuck them.  Yesterday Mom asked a couple of questions about my riding jacket and then went back into \"i don\\'t want to talk about this\" and i was like whatever you brought it up.  She\\'s starting to accept it I think.\\n\\nI know it\\'s not a big deal to most of you, but this is something i\\'ve wanted for 7 years now, and let my obsequious nature keep me from it.  I\\'ve been reading TRP for almost 3 months.  I have a lot more work to do on changing my programming, but I\\'ve finally made a step and done something for myself, and it feels good man.',\n",

Dad gets stuck with the usual child support routine, and I ended up being raised as a Blue Pill/White Knight when it comes to women, and was raised almost exclusively by women (mother, grandmother, aunts, etc.).\\n\\nProblem is, I am Alpha in my head when it comes to almost everything else.  The amount of cognitive dissonance this has caused me over the years is staggering, and I'm just now getting my head around it all.  I wasn't physically active, my intelligence translated into me being a bookwormy, soft sort, addicted to video games since I was 8, and largely ended up as a mess as I tried to balance my inner nature with what I had been programmed to believe and act.\\n\\nMy relationships with women have been staggeringly disastrous.  I pull women to me as I initially come across as confident as fuck (“I thought you were arrogant as hell when I first met you...and I wanted to fuck your brains out” said a plate I never took the courage to spin), and then watch the relationships turn into such much pain and suffering as I shift from the initial Alpha behavior to Beta patterns.  Regrettably, I never learned my lessons along the way.\\n\\nOne failed LTR when I was twenty-two actually pushed me hard into what I now recognize as TRP, but it ultimately didn't stick.  I gave myself a purpose, and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps.  I lost 65 pounds to get in, and another 35 once in.  I did well during my service, and my superiors pushed me into leadership roles as well as Instructor positions.   And, like so many dumbfuck Marines, I ended up getting married.\\n\\nOh, what a mistake.  Not only am I the idiot who tried to Blue Pill a marriage, but I selected the wrong women with not nearly enough examination of the situation.  Want to know how stupid I was?  Despite being a BLEEDING VICTIM of domestic violence, with her getting carted away in handcuffs, I proceeded to bail her out of jail, loaned her the money for Anger Management classes, and tried to save the trainwreck of a marriage.  One problem of an Alpha mindset is I often do not know when to give up.  Eventually, she filed for divorce.  Then, despite me driving away from it all with nothing but what I could fit into my car and leaving her with all the furniture/etc. which we received in the marriage, she tries to get alimony, my GI bill, and savings bonds.  Luckily, she neglected to TELL her divorce attorney about the domestic violence incident, and I don't lose everything.\\n\\nI move back home after the Corps.  I try to start over.  Get a HB 8 19 year old girlfriend when I'm 26, work full time, go to school in the evenings trying to better myself and obtain a real career.  And then, proceed to fuck it up ALL over again with the Blue Pill, as I lose ambition and don't maintain frame.  See above about me not learning lessons.  \\n\\nYears go by of me floundering, turning into AFC.  Though, if there's one constant in my life, it's that when I tap into my Alpha-ness, I end up doing great (especially when there is no poon to distract me).  I regain my focus, I get myself back to school to finish my B.A., kick ass, am given much respect in my field, offered a graduate assistantship, etc...and also proceed to get involved with yet another crazy bitch.\\n\\nSo this is four years ago.  We go into LTR mode, move in...and it's not awesome, but fuck, at least I'm not alone, and have pussy when I want it.  I do, however, keep pushing myself and striving for a career.  She says she doesn't want kids, which is fucking awesome to me, as I don't want to raise them.  But her not wanting kids is the tip of the Selfishness Iceberg with this woman; it is ALL about her.  \\n\\nOver the duration, I get my B.A. and my first Master's, using my GI Bill to pay for it all.  Meanwhile, my girlfriend has her parents pay for her degree and then does nothing with it, working a phone sales job making shit for money.  I knew I wanted to be a teacher, and in order to bypass the bullshit education route, I get myself into an extremely prestigious national program that puts high performing college graduates into the classroom.\\n\\nWe move across country (take a guess who paid for the movers/expenses?). I start teaching, and am living the dream.  Though...something is wrong.  I'm working 70+ hour weeks as I teach AND work on my second Master's.  I keep the house from becoming completely filthy.  I do any heavy chores,  I do the cooking.  I am responsible for Date Nights.  She works a crappy office job that she got when she moved out here, complaining constantly, and never working overtime.  She comes home every day, never seeking to have any social outlet or hobbies or friends.  At one point she signs up for a sewing class, goes to one, and then quits because “the instructor didn't seem helpful.”  Her 'cooking' consists of making a pan of brownies and then devouring them.  Her upper arms start to be bigger than my calves.  I am my usual glutton for punishment and too stubborn to admit failure.\\n\\nBut there was something changing inside me.  I kick ass at work.  I let my Alpha self come out more and more, and work with disadvantaged youth at our school, pushing them and getting accolades as my students show high growth.  I get promoted.  I get a perfect score on my Master's thesis and graduate with my second advanced degree that immediately translates into a raise.  And I start looking at my situation....and the Red Pill begins to go down my throat.\\n\\nI decide to buy a house, using what I saved from work and won from playing poker.  However, as LTR girl has no ambition and no savings, I state that she is welcome to live there, but I will not buy the house with her, and will require a modicum of rent, at what I estimate is 20% less than her monthly living expenses.\\n\\nShe loses it, calling me selfish and trying to 'profit' off her, and that she will only pay ½ utilities (but I know none of her other behavior will change).  I somehow maintain frame, and refuse to alter my position, because at this point my inner self KNOWS I'm being used as Beta Bucks (if not in that terminology yet).\\n\\nI end it after her final tantrum, and end up once again at the end of a LTR staring at the wreckage wondering WTF just happened.  I spend the summer trying to figure it out...and as I search the web for relationship info...I stumble upon /r/theredpill.\\n\\nWhy do my eyes hurt?  Because I've been screwing them shut for the past thirty-seven years, and have only just begun to use them.  The info and discussions I've read on this subreddit have been essential to my sanity and regaining a sense of purpose.  I've started to be physically active again, and am in initial training/physical rehab to get to lifting.  I have a house that I own.  I'm focused on my career as my primary purpose (You lose money chasing women, but never lose women chasing money), and am kicking more and more ass.  I've begun working on lessening my addictions.   I am self-examining and striving for self-improvement.  I feel like TRP is giving me my sense of self back, and a touchstone from which to move forward from here.\\n\\nSo, thanks.  It could have gone a different way.  I could have gone back to her, wailing and pleading like the Beta I know I can be.  But that's not what's going to happen, and I'm Going My Own Way now.  And it's going to be a great next thirty-seven years.  Thank you.\",\n",

She threw a hissy fit and left, I kept drinking.  Surprise surprise, she calls mere minutes after leaving and wants me to come over.  I let her know she\\'s hanging by a thread and proceed to fuck her brains out.  Come morning we go to an event (previously paid for) about an hour away in Miami.  She\\'s in full apology mode.  Road head, buys my gas, buys my drinks when we get there.  She\\'s insecure as fuck because we\\'re in the land of great tits, round asses and perfect tans.  She\\'s a struggling 5 in this market and she knows it.  So she likes to make \"drunk friends\" (read: get betas to buy her drinks, which is exactly what I called her out on) when we go out.  Only this time she\\'s going for the ego boost so she\\'s talking to tall built dudes instead of the lonely looking losers **and they aren\\'t giving her the time of day.**  Meanwhile I start chatting up the cocktail waitress (Short Latina, fake fits, perfect ass, dressed to impress) and she (gf) launches herself on me after striking out 3 different times and bites my bottom lip.  Hard.  I\\'ve told her before not to do this.  She does it to \"mark me\" because it leaves a red mark below my lip.  So I bite her back harder and she cops an attitude because \"she doesn\\'t like that because it hurts.\"  I leave her at the bar and grab a seat on the beach.  She sits down and starts going on about a research project (psychology grad student) about women in the military and asks my opinion.  I\\'m an infantry Marine, so I feed it to her straight.  She cops an attitude and leaves the event.  There is no reentry.  After 5 minutes she realizes I\\'m not coming out.  I sit and chat up a few girls at the bar and keep drinking while she blows up my phone.  An hour later I walk to my truck.  I check my phone.  Miss Independent has gotten herself lost in Miami at 11pm in nothing but a bikini.  I have her clothes, shoes and purse.  Gold.  I drop my tailgate tell her how to find me and tell her she\\'s got 20 minutes to get in the truck before I leave.  She makes it in 15 and I pull out.  She IMMEDIATELY starts bitching about what an asshole I am and says I should pull over if she\\'s such a bitch.  So I do.  She gets out and I leave that bitch in Miami.  Ten minutes later \"We\\'re so done.\"  Fifteen minutes later \"I want to talk about this.\"  30 minutes later she\\'s knocking on my door.  I let her in.  She immediately starts bitching and I show her out.  I have the biggest smile on my face right now because its 7:30 in the morning and she\\'s already blowing up my phone and I have zero fucks to give.  I love TRP.\\n\\nTL;DR Bitchy girlfriend thinks she\\'s too hot to handle.  Bitch got handled.\\n\\nThank you TRP.',\n",

Despite the fact neither of you are happy at the moment, you\\'ve clearly checked out of the relationship.\"\\n\\n\\nLooks at me with a slightly sad smile and says:\\n\\n\\n\"Good luck with your next relationship X.\"\\n\\n\\nEx wife was livid, hysterical, cried and claimed that I ambushed her into looking crazy and unreasonable... by not arguing with her or staying silent when I disagreed with what she was saying. I think she was mystified the female counsellor didn\\'t take her side. This is an intelligent woman that was an IT security professional and very good at her job, with a high IQ, made 130k+ p.a at the time but had clearly set her eyes on the next branch she wanted to swing to after completely betafying me. Arguments went up and sex went down from 3-5+ times a week to once a month, if that and no kinky stuff. Hypergamy is a bitch, she got the house and car of course, I simply washed my hands of her without a fight, a financial mistake in retrospect, still trying to be the good guy, pfft.\\n\\n(Back story- I was horribly unwell from a kidney transplant that went wrong at the time, yes I have kidney failure and am on dialysis but it hasn\\'t stopped me from achieving anything, like my PhD. But I was no longer what she signed up for initially, clearly. Which was an exceptionally good looking young guy, in amazing shape with a double degree in Chem/Biochem working in research, with a huge social circle of well to do friends. I also boxed and played rugby at a high level (state) was well read, could cook etc. You will undoubtedly think I\\'m bragging but I was asked to model a few of times, was in some tv commercials and a couple of print ads before I got sick, and I was in godly shape, no lie. My ex and I used to get propositioned for threesomes by random hot girls at bars, along with some of her friends and workmates unfortunately she was jealous as hell so nothing ever eventuated, sadly. Every time I even spoke to other girls she\\'d get angry and claimed I was flirting with them even if they initiated conversation. I\\'m just a really friendly, social guy tbh.) \\n\\n\\nAWALT. 3 weeks after we split up she hooks up with her current husband that she clearly had lined up, who is decent looking and in good shape but a complete fucking idiot, so she\\'ll be happy that he can\\'t argue/disagree with her because in comparison to me he\\'s borderline retarded, but makes decent bank because he\\'s a Major in the army. Good luck to them, they\\'ve got a kid now and she\\'s post wall-33 despite being pretty, blonde/blue big tits etc, he\\'s a player so I guarantee he\\'s fucking around. Poetic justice, oh and her family hate him and her parents still send me messages every Christmas and birthday which is a little weird but lovely.\\n\\nMy recent ex gf of 4 years was a step up from her anyway, Brazilian (Sexy Baiana ;) 9 years younger than I was) and completely fucking gorgeous (9-9.5), looked insane in a bikini and has a PhD in Immunology, we were both PhD students in the same institute when we met, but unfortunately after 4.5 years I went beta again, at the time I remember thinking, \"WTF have I become, I\\'m like another person, constantly biting my tongue and on edge, always trying to keep her happy but making myself (and her) miserable\" and she said pretty much the same thing, what happened to you? Since her I\\'ve had quite a few girls that were FWB, I took TRP after that breakup about 18 months ago, and have steadily been improving myself, lifting heavy, intense boxing training, socializing more, learning languages, reading prolifically once more, improved my wardrobe etc., getting closer to what I once was naturally, before I got sick; never again will I be betafied. \\n\\nMy current FWB/potential LTR is approximately 10 times better in all ways than my ex wife (and also 14yrs younger than the ex wife is now and 16.5 yrs younger than me ;). She\\'s 19, studying her undergrad, is a 9/10 with potential to be a 9.5, worships the ground I walk on, has only had 5 previous partners, 3 were in relationships (massively regrets the other 2), was brought up in a strict christian family but is an agnostic, is a complete sex kitten submissive and loves that I\\'m incredibly dominant because none of her exes were despite her requests (WTF guys, lucky for me). Most importantly she is ridiculously self aware, not impulsive, wants me to teach her to be my perfect partner and outright acknowledges RP values (I never mention TRP but sometimes conversations on certain topics pop up and she agrees completely). Incredibly she understands the SMV dynamics but doesn\\'t wield her beauty like a weapon even though she acknowledges guys fawn all over her because of it. Oh and she wants to have my babies in a couple of years... I win. I will however remain vigilant.\\n\\nThank you TRP.\\n',\n",

It was somewhere in between my Junior year and my First Victory Lap that I came upon TRP - at the time I was a pious Evangelical young man that detested the words that were on my screen.\\n\\nI closed the browser and turned away from my computer, Beta move that one... The majority of my college experience was spent flitting from one ~~woman~~ girl to another in the most Beta (and Christian) of ways.  Flowers here, a coffee there, a bag of gluten-free cookies from a ubiquitous brand that you can only find on the shelves Marshalls. Always pandering to the idea of the ONE that was out there - Clearly I wasn\\'t ready.\\n\\nA few years later, working a side job while starting my own venture and I found TRP again.  Naive ideals have been stripped away not by venom-dripping girls, but simply by time.  The desire to please everyone cast aside by pursuing my own venture instead of filing in line behind everyone else on the way to work.  Something curious happened over the years and I\\'m still not sure what - I just know that if nothing changes, nothing changes.\\n\\nThis journey into TRP is just one facet of learning to love self-development and growth.

       "  'selftext': 'Hello,\\n\\nI apologize in advance for the below, it\\'s really late here and I\\'m tired but I had to share.  Also, english not my first language. \\n\\nI\\'ve always been a real beta. I mean I love women, like REALLY love them: Their hair, their laughs, everything. I\\'ve always wanted to get with more women throughout my entire life but never really did bc I was scared and it was better for me to be in a dull LTR bc at least I got SOME sex. My partner is a very caring lady, very nice family etc but lost interest a long time ago despite not knowing it...\\n\\nI\\'ve been in a LTR for about 9 years now, since high school (I missed the sweet land of College). She\\'s my first sexual partner, she had one before me (Lost her virginity at 15-16) who was just getting sex (at 15, yea I know, good for him) and did a lot of sexual things I was never allowed to do. The LTR, 4 of those years have been long distance while the two of us are at school and/or working. Long story short, we\\'d meet up for our get togethers after 1-3 months. I own my own home so this is easy to feel comfortable. Even with a 1-2 week time together, we\\'d only have sex 1-2. And it would be robotic: I\\'d have to make her cum first which she has to try SUUUPPPEEERR hard as she NEVER was actually in the mood but she would humour me or say that \"we should\". The sex for me was so lame but I was so happy I got it. I was stressed bc of school and work and anything was better than nothing...\\n\\nShe also would play video games and got fat in the last 4 years. Her sex drive plummeted even more. Add the fact that we would mandatorily talk for at least 1 hour every single day but when we were together we wouldn\\'t have sex because she didn\\'t feel \"connected\". I was her emotional tampon. However, we would always go on dates and spend my money (Mainly bc we were bored).  \\n\\nI always thought in the back of my head how I wanted to explore the world of women. Deep down, I didn\\'t want to settle but I had bought a house, we were talking of marriage, kids etc. The more I pondered this, the more I asked myself \"If I was to be on my death bed tomorrow, I would really regret not dating other girls. Specifically, not having sex with at least one other one\". This really made me feel bad...\\n\\nI\\'ve been on the path of self improvement for awhile with respect to work (Since I have so much time alone). The EMSK post for TRP cued my interest, I took the pill and the rest, like most guys, was anger, rage, sadness etc. I read a lot and learned lots. It was really hard for me but I embraced the alpha as there were so many men, so so many men who got divorced raped or had suffered so much. \\n\\nI told my LTR I wanted a break as I felt we were disconnected and I needed time \"figure out me\". She honestly doesn\\'t respect me or find me attractive at all any more but this is unconscious and not her fault. I didn\\'t want to bother putting in the time to transform the relationship from the inside. I needed to unplug and never go into that old beta position again, it would be far to hard. \\n\\nI decided \"I\\'m going to chat to girls today and use some GAME\". Bc I dress really well for work, this was an amazing experience. I felt powerful beyond anything before, I had confidence and got a few numbers. I didn\\'t end up calling any though as I was right out of the beta illusion. \\n\\nWeeks later, I went hiking and met a chick randomly, we hit it off and I got her number. We ended up meeting for tea and I was going to make a move bc \"Alphas or guys who take initiative sexually, are rewarded for doing so\". I touched her lower back on the way into the shop first thing after meeting her (Which she tells me was a total cue I was in charge), was calm and slightly amused at her cute stories. Strong, silent but also a little fun. She\\'s totally petit and stacked. Super feminine, intelligent. \\n\\nAt the end of tea, we were by my car (helps I have a pretty nice car) and I had said I had to go home and check on something and moved in and kissed her. THAT KISS WAS FUCKING AMAZING, I haven\\'t felt like that in years. I could tell she loved it, I ended up putting her in my car and going home. She had a super huge smile on her face. \\n\\nAt home we chatted more and I made my move in the kitchen. We ended making out and then having sex. Alpha fucks. I gave it to her hard (\\nSex God Method), like fucking hard. I was so good for me and her. We had sex a few times, our bodies ached. Bc of that, the next few days was amazing. She felt \"liberated by how good I was at sex and how hard I have it to her\" and she felt comfortable with me to do shit she\\'s never done before (Choking, rough, anal, watching in the mirror). She cooked for me and she wanted to please me so badly bc I\\'m rich and young but was showing alpha qualities learned @ TRP. She wanted to please me so bad she asked if I wanted my dick sucked at the kitchen table with the meal SHE MADE ME. She did it willingly, with a smile and LOVED IT. I\\'ve never felt more like a man. I almost cried it was so amazing, not just physically but mentally and emotionally. \\n\\nIn short, if I was to die tomorrow, I would die a happy man doing the things I biologically needed for a long time. \\n\\nIf I didn\\'t find TRP, I would have been forever unhappy and would have regretted my life. I\\'m still adjusting and the above was the very deep end for me. Work in progress, one day at a time. \\n\\nAgain, thank you. \\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'My last relationship was me being beta bucks for a single mother. I was raising someone else\\'s child (the day I broke up with her, she had me babysit for 6 hours in the morning before I left to work all night, her mother would have normally babysat, but canceled so that she could get a hair cut). I resented it. I began improving myself, exercising and eating right. She tried to join in, but eventually \"gave up\" with the workouts. I wasn\\'t a \"complete\" blue pill, but it was slowly turning that way, she started denying me sex after 1 year together (the sex was ok prior to that, but she was a little stretched out compared to most women I\\'ve been with, I don\\'t think she got stiched up correctly after her baby, I\\'ve been with about 50 women and this is the loosest I\\'d ever been with, but otherwise was really happy with the sex). I decided to move on, because I knew that I could do better. Turns out she\\'d been texting and flirting with \"a friend\" for 2 months prior to me breaking up with her, including asking him to \"come cuddle with her\". I knew that her denying me sex was a super duper red flag thanks to TRP. She said nothing happened, but it was definitely something she was fantasizing about. This was not a remarkable woman, an assistant branch manager at a bank, 27, about a 6 (7 on a good day). After I broke up with her, she told me she was pregnant with my baby. She decided to abort. Evidently the drug using alcoholic father of her first baby that called her a slut and cut off all contact after she told him she was pregnant was good enough to carry to term, but not my child. She laughed at me behind my back when I broke down in tears after the abortion in the car with her (I read the texts she sent her guy \"friend\" after that was VERY rough).\\n\\nI\\'m now, at 32 in the best shape of my life. When I was 23, in the air force, I had a 40 inch waist and weighed 225lbs (5\\'8\")\\n\\nI\\'m now at a 34\" waist at 195 I\\'m not complete, but it\\'s so much better than I was. 3 years ago I was pushing 250.\\n\\nI banged a hot 18 year old tonight after texting for a week. Yes, she\\'s a little emotionally damaged, and I\\'m not saying that I\\'m god\\'s gift to men now, but I certainly wasn\\'t pulling anything this hot before, and I definitely would have been falling in love with this girl, where as now I can easily point out the signs that she\\'s not good LTR material and I know not to get so emotionally attached.\\n\\nP.S. It\\'s the 4th different lay I\\'ve had in the past 2 weeks.\\n\\nThanks TRP.',\n",

Stumbling here was a huge relief that there was other people like this and I wasn't a sociopath for feeling like society was slightly off. But I'm here to really thank you all finally for helping me get something done I couldn't do on my own. After a week of not boozing for the first time in my life and replacing that time with exercise I've already shed 7lbs. I don't think the motivation to work out and drink so much less would have come without you guys.

       "  'selftext': \"Similar sob story to most of the fuckers on here. I married young to my first fuck (quite hot mind you), both mid 30's now. Beta'd my way to a sexless marriage for more years than I care to consider. I was the classic Mr. Nice Guy from the side bar. About 12 months ago I started swallowing the red pill without knowing it what it was, but regressed because I didn't have the right goals or pathway.\\n\\nAbout 6 months ago I was all but ready to end the marriage and walk. I laid this out for my wife and things improved somewhat, but it all came to a head recently and I started to get an exit plan together.\\n\\nWhile researching exit plans on /r/deadbedrooms I saw a reference to The Red Pill, I followed it up figuring I had nothing to lose. Wow, fucking wow!\\n\\nI was at the absolute bottom with zero fucks to give which made swallowing the pill that much easier.\\n\\nTo say it turned my life around is an understatement, my balls are now firmly attached. The key things that have changed in my life are:\\n\\n* I'm lifting *(Stronglifts 5x5 is excellent, eating a lot is hard)*\\n* Got a new wardrobe *(make sure you look good around the house too, set the standard)*\\n* Make eye contact\\n* Assertive at work\\n* Improved posture\\n* Stopped playing video games *(too busy doing productive things)*\\n* Decisiveness\\n* Girls on the street checking me out\\n* Reading again *(and more non-fiction)*\\n* Improved my relationship with my sons \\n* And of course my relationship with my wife has improved dramatically *(yes relationship not just our sex life).*\\n\\nWith my wife I'm passing shit tests (lots of text shit tests), being physically flirty (ass slaps, head grabs for deep kisses), getting respect, dread game, amused mastery, being dominant in and out of the bedroom. It's fucking awesome. My wife knows who's in charge now and she likes it despite some ongoing confusion as roles change.\\n\\nShe is really enjoying the sex and sends me heaps of dirty texts in anticipation during the day. I'm enjoying the sex more and lasting longer (Make sure you read the Sex God Method). I'm getting BJ's regularly (previously only under sufferance because *“she’s not that type of girl”*). Her period week is now BJ week. Hell I even got a great BJ while driving! (I've been dying to share that with someone).\\n\\nI'm still not holding frame consistently and some shit tests are still going through to the keeper. However the contrast is sharp.\\n\\nAnd the best part about discovering TRP is I now have the opportunity to raise my sons with a regular dose of TRP so they don't waste half their lives trying to live up to a false ideal.   \\n\\ntl;dr Swallowed Red Pill appears to have saved marriage and self improvement is awesome.\\n\\nEdit: added tl;dr\\n\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'This story began some time ago, during my freshman year. I was coming out of 3 years of prep school. Needless to say, those 3 years had been filled with work and only work. No parties, no friends, no hobbies, no sex. \\n\\nAfter this dry spell of 3 years, I finally entered college were everyone were horny and fucking like rabbits. I met this girl. She wasn’t beautiful. She wasn’t clever. She didn’t have anything worth mentioning beside two things : she had a vagina and she was ready to give it to me. I fucked her like hell. Before her I had sex with only one girl so I fucked her like my life depended on it. \\n\\nSoon, though, my behavior began to change. The alpha traits I was displaying were gone and my beta conditioning appeared. I asked for commitment. I saw her flirting with other men, even grinding some of them in front of me. I told her I would not flirt with any other women. This was a covert contract : I expected her to say she would do the same but she said nothing.\\n\\n Like I have been taught, I slowly began to show her my weaknesses. It was a process that would allow me to become more and more intimate with her, I thought. You know, showing her who I really am and being true to each other. This lifelong partner, this perfect female that would support me whatever happens. Strangely, though, she began to make mention of other men. I visited her one night and woke her up and she said to me “shit, it’s the wrong man”. Sex began to be less fun. What she was doing was laying back and spreading her legs in the missionary position, waiting for me to cum in her. She would moan a little. I was convinced. On the inside, I knew there was something wrong but deep down I knew, thanks to what I’ve been told, that from the very moment her lips touched mine, she became my soul partner and that she would love me forever. I knew her “mistakes” were just that: mistakes, and that she was doing whatever she could to not make them anymore.\\n\\n On Christmas, she was visiting her parents in Paris, where I was during the holidays too. “I don’t have time to see you”. I was frustrated : why couldn’t she find at least one hour for me? She was living an hour from my house, she was staying during one week in Paris, how in the world could she not find time? I asked her to send nudes to me. She said no. While I was staying at home, laying in bed, she was going out and getting drunk. I was very insecure in regard of alcohol. I didn’t knew why. She sent me pictures of her doing pole dance for other guys “I would have liked to give you some pole dance too”. She was living an hour from my home. \\n\\nAfter the holidays, we came back to college which was in another town. Something had changed. She would talk about her ex-boyfriend who was coming into town. She said she knew it was to bang her but that it seemed he finally couldn’t make it on the scheduled week-end. However, I didn’t see her this week-end. She wasn’t answering phone calls or text messages. I was feeling worse and worse. I have been giving up my friends, my family, my hobbies and my passions and my classes for her. On the other hand, she was still studying and partying with other people. “You would be a lot more jealous if you were to see me in a night club”. I went out with the friends I still had. A guy from my school came to me on the dance floor and asked me if I was still in a relationship with the girl. I felt really insecure. A feeling that something were wrong, that I wasn’t being treated the way I wanted and that she had a negative influence on my life began to rise. But I needed her so much. Then, she began to ask me to get engaged. But before that, she insisted to see some photos of the boat and the second house I told her my parents owned. She began to talk about a baby too. \\n\\nI failed my freshman year but we moved together during the second year. There, she bought me a TV, a PS4 and I spent my days playing, looking at films. I was mentally ill : my world was filled only with this girl but our relationship was driving me insane. But it was not her fault. Whose fault was it anyway? Mine, according to her. But I didn’t knew. So I hid in video games and virtual world. I got expelled from college. I would bang her when she come back from college, every night. But, in fact, no. Not every night. She began to say she had to work with some friends at school every night. But I knew well the school was closed after 6pm. And she could do her homework here! I would help her! I was not a dumb kid after all. All my teachers once had high hopes for me. But that was when I still was in high-school or college.\\n\\n She began to come back home later and later. Some time, she would not come back at all. I didn’t know why and every time I asked she would slap me in the face. One night, I came back from the bar where I got drunk and I found her naked with another woman in our bed. There was a video camera in front of the bed. With horror and fear, I opened it and realized she had been filming her making love to this girl. My heart sank. It was like I was being stabbed. She was sleeping so I turned the camera off and left. I came back next morning and she was as usual. She had spent the previous evening doing her homework. I agreed and came to the bar more often. I felt deep down something had to be done. But this girl was all I had left. Losing her would be losing everything. She became pregnant. It was weird because we only had sex without a condom once but hey, it was luck! \\n\\nShe began to transform completely. She told me to get a job to support “us” financially while she would get her degree. Then, she would be the one having a job and supporting us. My friends were long time gone. My family was against this marriage so I cut contact with them. \\n\\nOne night after coming back from my shitty job, I went crazy. It was too much. I took her phone, her computer and stalked her. I found photos of her with other men. There was nudes of her sent to other guys on the phone. I recalled those Christmas holidays when she didn’t wanted to send me nudes. Then I checked the computer. I found some photos of her sucking other guy’s dicks. It was like a hall of fame. She had a sex list. In horror, I found a word document where she described the encounters she had had with the men on her sex list. Comments like “his dick were juicy”, “he fucked me like I’ve never been fucked” and even one “fucking him and knowing my husband were sleeping on the other side of the wall was incredibly exciting”. I recalled how often she would go to the neighbor’s apartment to get a massage.  I didn’t have her facebook password. I entered her bedroom (I was sleeping on the couch now) and searched everything. I found nothing. There must had been a mistake. Or a bad joke. When she came back that night, we had an argument. She told me to hit her if it could help me feel better. I was practicing martial arts before I met her. I had been practicing for around ten years. Part of me was saying not to hit her, reminding myself of my teacher’s teachings. But her screaming in tears that she was a slut and that she deserved to be hit and that she would be happy to be hit by the man she loved, by the man she didn’t deserve because she was such a piece of filthy shit compared to him made me act in anger and despair. And I hit her. All the anger. All the frustration. All the things I didn’t understood in our relationships, all the nights spent torturing myself because of her. With all my might, I hit her with the most destructive punch I learned during my Kung-Fu training. I broke her shoulder and I kept slapping her on the face, asking her in tears why she did that. She went to the hospital and got healed without saying anything about me hitting her. \\n\\nAfter that, things began to change. Our baby was about one year old, I was devoured by shame and regrets of what I’ve done and the authoritative and angry wife turned into a still person that would avoid me. She began to go sleep to some other places with our baby for periods of one week or two. I would say nothing because I understood how much of a monster I am. Then, she graduated. I came back one night and she told me she had just been having a threesome with two other men. She showed me the video and told me “Now, hit me. Hit me to punish the dirty whore I am”. I hit her again. She went to the cops. She is now filling for divorce, moving to another town with her degree and her baby. I am un-employed, alone and isolated from anyone else including family, I don’t have any money anymore and I have child custody to pay, I don’t have a degree. I have been diagnosed with severe depression and I stay at home all day doing drugs and taking my antidepressants, waiting for the cops to force me to get out of the apartment which bill I didn’t pay. I tried to reach out for my family but they don’t want to have anything to do with me. \\n\\nSo. This is a partly fictional story. Everything is true until the part where we moved together. Thanks to God, things went differently. But I thank God and everything on earth that things didn’t ended up this way. I often think about what would have happened and this kind of story often comes to mind.\\nHere is what actually happened instead : \\n\\nThis story began some time ago, during my freshman year. I was coming out of 3 years of prep school. Needless to say, those 3 years were filled with work and only work. No parties, no friends, no hobbies, no sex. After this dry spell of 3 years, I finally entered college were everyone were horny and fucking like rabbits. I met this girl. She wasn’t beautiful. She wasn’t clever.

She began to talk about a baby too. I decided it was too much and that she was making my life miserable. I broke up with her. During the next few weeks I discovered TRP and went onto the anger phase. I was diagnosed with severe depression and couldn’t go out of my room anymore. But I somehow managed to go to some classes. My blue pill conditioning has made me addicted to this girl. The pain of losing the only thing I had left in my life (her) and the pain of swallowing the pill made my life a living hell during the last few months of freshman year. I cut contact with anyone but my family who supported me like no one ever supported me. I got medication for my depression and I am now working my butt off to build my life back once again. I began to work out, I picked up acupuncture and martial arts training and I work every day to get back on tracks in college. I have finals at the end of August to not get expelled from college.**',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I came across this sub in Feb., but was boozing, partying, and attempting to live up my last semester of college far too much to pay attention. I started reading in June again- partly due to more time, partly due to frustration, and finally like many others in part because of the negative outside attention. Anyways, I fully swallowed the pill by the end of June. \\n\\nSome stuff, I had subconsciously emulated from others or figured out myself over the years suddenly made sense. I suddenly had names and terms for things I had sensed before- namely demonstrating SMV, acting dark triad, prior selection, and a few others- these subconscious actions had gotten me pussy I had previously thought was random and just thrown at me. \\n\\nBut more importantly, this sub has allowed me to recognize the flaws in myself that had led to me not being happy in the first place- Number 1 and more then anything **crippling** **oneitis**! For the first time in my adult life, I have this sense of being free from this girl who I wanted to marry when I was 17. No matter how drunk I got, whatever personal, financial, social, academic success I made, I had been able to remove her memory from my head.\\n\\nI truly believed- hoped- prayed- that this girl would come back to me for money like she always said she would when we were younger. Suddenly, all of the beta bux shit made so much sense! I was heartbroken when she went off to a different school to party, and I chased the bottle for a better part of 5 years because of it. I was so blind to her shit that even after pulling girls much better looking I would still pretend they were her. I\\'d even stoop as low as stalking her facebook and shit, just waiting for her to come back to me. It was some truly pathetic beta bux bullshit and I\\'m finally past it. \\n\\nAnyways, I have poured myself into my new career, positive and **beneficial** friendships, and hit the gym again. I\\'ve made the moves for perhaps one of the toughest battles I\\'ve put off- going back to a full paleo diet, and start that next sunday. I know it will be easier then my countless failed attempts of the last 3 years because I finally stopped chasing those stupid beta dreams and drowning the memories in booze which is a natural block to successful dieting. I see alcohol now more as a useful tool, a tool that I don\\'t have the power to use for the time being. It\\'s a means to an end in my mind now, and not \"the end\"- the end of many relationships, both sexual and platonic, strained family ties, health problems, hospital visits, arrests, drunken bar fights, a near drowning in a third world country- I\\'m serious, that almost happened during a 72 hour cocaine, energy drink, whiskey, and tequila filled period a year or two ago- I could truly go on with this shit for a while.\\n\\nCut the fat- and moved on from a personal relationship with a \"best friend\" who wasn\\'t really more then an extreme dark triad enabler suffering from Anti-social personality disorder and extreme bi-polar moodswings. He was my partner in my.. alcoholism... If we\\'re gonna call a spade a spade here.. We enabled each other for the worse. We had some great times, but I barely remember a lot of them now. I\\'ve moved out and into a place with two extremely natural red pill, in control friends.  \\n\\nI\\'ve passed up on a huge swanky event I normally would be absolutely blacked out for and blowing ridiculous money on tonight to catch up on my laundry, and finish the move into my new place. Plus, the boss asked me to work Saturdays because I\\'ve been grossing so much since I\\'ve abandoned the booze and the accompanying come downs. Oh yeah, I was well past \"hangovers\"- I\\'m talking the comedowns that last 20 hours and require heavy benzodiazepine use just to control the shakes and heart palpitations. When you find yourself trying to control your dry heaving and diarrhea so your boss doesn\\'t hear you- yeah it\\'s time to move on. \\n\\n\\nAnyways, there was a lot more little things that I have to work on, but just the oneitis and alcohol demon being gone makes all the rest so much easier to process. I\\'ve been going back on my previous sexual encounters and relationships and identifying the successes and failures- The successes are almost all tied to game I was unknowingly playing, and the failures were all examples of me failing to hold frame, or playing down my natural dominating traits in order to \"make a woman feel comfortable\" when in fact all I was doing was shooting myself in the foot and drying up her panties like a truck stop hand blower. Finally, I realized that showing the commitment card too quickly fucked me over way too many times. Instead of pointless \"cuddling\", breakfast dates, and morning \"talks\" in bed after sex, I should have cut those woman out of my place as fast as possible. Doing what I thought would naturally make these women feel comfortable and lead to more sex ended up causing me frustration. \\n\\nSince everyone is interested in field reports, I went out and tried this shit and new poise with a girl I\\'ve known for years and never done anything with. I would have fucked her in the back of my friends car if her friend wouldn\\'t have  been a drunk cockblock, but that\\'s besides the point. It served as self validation and just a reminder that I\\'m not where I\\'m at yet or I would have been able to handle getting her out of there and her ugly ass friend to boot. \\n\\nI still have a **lot** of work to go to get to where I\\'m capable of and where I want to be, but I\\'m going somewhere again boys, and it feels good. Whatever groups of white knights and females that want to attack the good work of this sub and school of thought is doing for people- let them. They are irrelevant. Throughout history, powerful men have gathered through a variety of forums to share thoughts and progress the world. Do you think the founding fathers weren\\'t ostracized by beta orbiters and traditional females? They can throw stones from afar, but the temple will still be built gentlemen, as it has been for centuries. \\n\\n',\n",

I started improving every part of my life, lost weight, started socialising, got some hobbies, started a new career..

Because of my RP knowledge I'm able to get exactly what I want from her and keep her attention like I didn't think was possible.

After a year and a half of self improvement I've become attractive and enjoy the benefits that brings. \\n\\nMost importantly, by doing this I've built happiness for myself.

       "  'selftext': '**TL;ain\\'t reading all that shit** Working on living RP values and preaching the truth to other men. Helped my brother fix a frame issue with his ex. Thanks TRP.\\n\\nSee, the thing is, he listened to me about asking for a prenup ages ago, which sent her into psycho-beast mode. \"You don\\'t *trust* me! I can\\'t marry someone who doesn\\'t *trust* me.\" So there was no marriage. Small victory because there was a child.\\n\\nAnd thankfully my chorus of \"don\\'t trust her\", cemented by the refusal of the prenup, was enough to save him from the trauma of something similar to the brutal divorce rape I experienced.\\n\\n**In the custody hearing the judge not only awarded primary custody to my brother (HOLY SHIT, it does happen! Like a fucking black swan) but also attached a special note to the case file should they ever end up back in court that she was not a fit mother, had a history of drug abuse and poor choices including staying in a physically abusive relationship with her first husband... (the judge was frickin\\' psychic, also a man, and a good-ole-boy in the deep south)**\\n\\nAnd you know what?\\n\\n**She still got child support, and he pays for her car, even though they split time with their child 50/50 and he has primary custody... WTF?\"**\\n\\nYes WTF indeed.\\n\\nShe still tries to fuck with his mind because, well, she is a woman and lost in court. Do you know what kind of cognitive dissonance that causes to self-entitled women who expect their pussy pass to hold up in court?\\n\\n**KABOOM**\\n\\nHamster on steroids.\\n\\nAs he was telling me this morning that she was giving him some shit about something to do with their daughter and her discipline I went off. I explained loudly and enthusiastically how she would never win in court again with that note attached to the front essentially saying \"this drugged out whore should never be in charge of raising the child of this union over her Father\". \\n\\nI explained quickly and succinctly how the courts are weapons against men, yet his story\\'s outcome is actually an EPIC fucking win for a man (sadly).\\n\\nThen I told him how to handle this morning\\'s bunch of bullshit from his ex.\\n\"When our daughter comes home from your house, her discipline is awful and she won\\'t do or listen to anything I say.\"\\n\\nOkay, lets deconstruct this a little bit. \"comes home from your house\" - it is your fault, and furthermore it is the fault of the family and friends you expose her to. Blame shifting. Fuck that.\\n\\nSo what did I tell him. **You agree and amplify.** Turn that shit around with a dollop of truth and figuratively slap her with the cold reality of it.\\n\\nYou say, \"Yes, her discipline has been poor recently, she is 4, but she acts more like your other daughter than she does any child in our family, you need to work on your parenting skills.\"\\n\\n**BOOM** Slap that hamster back into place, put the emphasis where it should be (her poor parenting skills) and defuse what she is trying to build for the next court visit (a history of his poor parenting that is a complete fabrication) that will be coming because she did not get the outcome she expected from the court/casino the first time. It isn\\'t that hard to figure this shit out once you know what you are looking for.\\n\\nI\\'m posting this here because I\\'m still marinating in TRP sidebar wisdom. One day I\\'ll be ready to post to r/TheRedPill, until then, I learn and spread the truth where I can.\\n\\nI\\'ll post up my experiences as a wedding official (minister, whatever, I marry people, usually for free) who counsels men against marriage. (no free wedding official without counseling). I think I have some interesting observations from that viewpoint, nothing ground breaking, just more reinforcement examples.\\n\\nThere is a reason I call myself an \"it\" Manager. NOT IT Manager, though I do a shit-ton of IT services where I work. I am an \"it\" manager. When \"it\" hits the fan, I get called in to clean \"it\" up, because I\\'m the only one with the skill set to figure \"it\" out. Whatever \"it\" it is.\\n\\nThis applies to my life also. I manage my shit. I work hard and I pursue my hobbies and interests just as hard, and I have a lot of them, you should too.\\n\\nHere is a quote to give you something to work with:\\n\\n\"The master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation, his love and his religion. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence at whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him he is always doing both.\" -James Michener\\n\\nThat comes from a time when men were still men.\\n\\nIf there are any veteran RP\\'ers around that see anything in there that needs critiquing or correcting, please, step up and point it out. I make no claim to perfection. \\n\\nI\\'m making progress, thank you TRP for helping me figure out how to communicate like a man with other men. It is helping all of us.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Tl;dr at the bottom..\\n\\nSo I have been lurking for almost more than half a year, TRP has already helped me understand some things my BP old self wouldnt even have considered to understand ( I am by no means RP now, more like in training/to be TRP) Here is a little back story of myself.\\n\\nWe are back in January the 5th of 2014, I finally admited to the girl, I had serious onitis for more than a year, that I had a crush on her. We talked and she confesed she felt the same way. We kissed and I was proud of myself and happy. The next day I went off to england for educational purposes for 10 weeks. \\n\\nIn England, texts would be exchanged with said girl every day how we miss each other and how I cant wait to get back. I turned down a HB8 with the excuse that I had a girlfriend (which wasnt true atm, because said girl and I agreed to wait till I get back home till we make it offical), the HB8 still continued to hit on me and she even askd if she could kiss me. At that moment I wasnt even thinking anymore and just went with the flow. We would have gone home with each other but we both lived with guest/host families. So that was a no go for both of us.\\n\\nFast forward to the next morning, I felt like shit because I thought that I cheated on onitis girl. This feeling continued for a few days and then I saw the HB8 again in a club. She was smiling and teasing me with her body while dancing. I gave in again, and we had another long make out session. After that night I stopped going to clubs for almost 2 weeks. The HB8 left and I was reliefed(I knew from a friend of mine that she asked where I was and that she would leave.)\\n\\nFastforward again to my 8th week in england where said onitis girl comes to visit me! She was all like \"I\\'m so happy to see you, if missed you\" jadajada. She stayed for 3 days. Over these 3 days she distanced herself more and more, and before she left she said to me\"I want to take it slow when you come back\" I felt like shit, a switch was already turned in my head that this would be over. Felt like shit for another 1 week where I went full BP through texts, saying shit like I miss her and did the opposite of the 2/3 rule.\\n\\nThe last week arrives and we stopped texting because I thought I shouldnt always be the one iniating texts. No texts from her till I got back.\\n\\nWhen I arrived at the airport at home I got a text from her saying something like \"Have you already landed?I think we need to talk\" at that moment I already knew it was over.\\n\\nFastforward again, we meet up to talk, first some bullshit small talk then she said something like \"your more like a friend to me, I dont have feelings for you anymore, but I hope we stay friends and it wont change something between us\". And the answer I gave her still makes me mad, it was \"Yeah sure it wont change a thing\" \\n\\nAfter that I got into TRP and started lurking, broke off contact and started going to the gym. Doing something with my body again feels great (I have a athletic body because I did sports my entire life till last year)\\n\\nTRP helped me understand why this all turned out the way it did with said onitis girl, that me going full BP and almost spamming her with text messages and losing frame constantly made me \"lose\" her.\\n\\nAfter that I only saw her once again and that was at a mutual friends birthday party. First I ingored her after a not so interesded \"Hi\" to everybody. After that I enjoyed my beer and cigaret for a while. She then sat down right next to me and asked how I was, \"I said fine and you?\" (with i monotone tone behind it) She responded with a\" yeeaaahh im alright\" my old BP self would have asked her what was bothering her, but I just thought to myself \" you came her to talk to me, I dont have to keep the conversation going\" after a few silent seconds she stood up and walked back to her female friends. I couldnt have cared less at that moment and I actually felt great. \\n\\nTl;dr: Told my long time onitis girl I had a crush on her, we kissed, went full BP and \"lost\" her and now thanks to TRP understand why.\\n\\nI am now reliefed because I now  understand what was going on.\\nI will continue to better myself, educate myself,train more and read more. Thank you TRP, thank you so much.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I\\'m not sure if it\\'s post-worthy, but I want to share some thoughts.\\n\\nI had a real rough life in my childhood, knee-deep in the poverty and shit, people making fun out of me all the time, and being raised? by a single mother. All the previous experiences in my life didn\\'t make me strong, but full of beta behavior, serious lack of confidence, anxiety and so on... But I am not that ugly, I have decent knowledge in programming and linux sysadmin stuff. I performed 100% in english and IT exams this year.\\n\\nI\\'ve found TRP two months ago and I\\'ve found it so true that it make me understand a whole lot of things. I can\\'t be mad over the past because it won\\'t help it. I think I can see some truth here and there, but the most important lesson for me is that I can change to fulfill my own needs and dreams however I want without appealing to some people. I have a lot to do, and everything here isn\\'t full of roses. I am a student, thus I don\\'t have the papers to apply for jobs, the other jobs aren\\'t open either. I can\\'t have the money to buy better clothes, go to gym, or buy stuff because of future hobby. Scarcity mentality heh. I am wondering if there is anything that could kick my ass so hard to realise to make things happen, act now. It\\'s too comfortable to live without action, so comfortable that it poisoned me, because things \"just happen\".\\n\\nAnyway, even if I still have some toxic thoughts, TRP hinted me the way I have to live, to fight for it, so the first step for me is to have more actions than regrets. Without TRP I would sit there with the evergrowing frustration of being hopeless helpless. There is always hope, we just have to give ourselves the help.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Just felt, after two or three months of lurking, absorbing, and now winning at life thanks to TRP, I should subscribe and share a bit.\\n\\nI’m early 30s, married since early 20s.  I’m a professional, currently raising three kids with my stay-at-home wife.  Met her in college and married right after…we were each others’ firsts.\\n\\nIn some ways I was pretty alpha, albeit unknowingly, through college. I’ve always been tall and athletic, decent looking, football/basketball captain in high school, rugby in college.  I got decent grades without trying, threw many parties, hooked up a decent amount (but not fucking, b/c we were all good little catholic kids).  I was entertaining interest from a couple of girls at the same time I was hooking up with my future wife.  I know now that me showing less interest in her made her all the more interested in me.  \\n\\nBut I had no clue about game or what it meant to be a man.  I was pretty timid around good looking girls (unless drunk). I was consuming a lot of pron, and I had no ambition. I had pretty much completely bought into the feminized, romanticized, betasized view of women and men.  Basically, I thought myself a nice guy and was proud of it. \\n\\nSo I became more and more beta toward my future wife.  Got engaged right after college because that’s what she wanted and that’s what I thought you were supposed to do.  Somehow, we survived law school together, but over the years, I deferred pretty much every decision and responsibility to her because I didn\\'t care and my preferences, in my mind, did not outweigh rocking the boat with my increasingly bitchy girl. I basically became a frustrated shell of a man, and my wife would tell me as much. \\n\\nI didn’t know what to do. Whenever I did try to assert myself, she would go into bitch mode.  Basically, whether consciously or not, she was shit testing me, and I would cower and fail miserably.  I would usually just not do stuff with friends in order to avoid having to get her approval.\\n\\nOf course, I tried to fix things by going more beta because that\\'s what I thought guys are supposed to do.  I would do more for her around the house, do more and more mother-type parenting, do more dishes, change more diapers, express more and more beta…and it was never good enough. I couldn’t figure out why it didn’t work…I figured this was just the way things were going to be until death or she left me. \\n\\nIn bed, I was a big fat pussy.  I did not ask for, let alone take, what I really wanted, because I was afraid of what she would think. I thought that was the way it was supposed to be.  I tried to \"make love.\"  But then, I would still sneakily go whack to pron, watching other men do the things I wanted but didn\\'t have the balls to do…fucking embarrassing.  But sluts are the worst and I didn’t want my wife to think I thought of her that way.\\n\\nMeanwhile, physically, I got fatter and softer.  I became more and more invisible to women.\\n\\nBasically, I had handed my balls over to my wife, and she despised me for it.  She may have still loved me a little bit, but it was basically just us having kids and her being a jihad Catholic that kept her from leaving me.\\n\\nSo I would try to quit pron from time to time because I knew that was unhelpful to realizing myself as a man.  But it was always unsuccessful...I know now it was more a symptom, not the cause of my problems.  But two or three months ago, I found my way to r/nofap, which then lead me to TRP.  \\n\\nMy god, it was a revelation.  For a month or two, I devoured everything on TRP and everything in the side bar.  I started listening to NMMNG on my commute (that book explained my life to a T). I was living Aristotle\\'s analogy of the cave.  I immediately decided to become the man I wanted to be and to become the man my wife probably wished she could leave me for. So, I\\'ve continued reading everything TRP and implementing the TRP things I was once paralized by fear from doing.  \\n\\nHere\\'s some of what I\\'ve done and what\\'s happened:\\n\\n- When everything clicked, I literally lost all interest in porn.  It felt pathetic to think about, and I felt like a fucking hercules without it.\\n\\n- At home, I started making decisions, just for the sake of actually making decisions, whether I cared or not. It worked.  I would answer her questions with an actual answer instead of being wishy-washy.  And I would tell her what we were going to do...not ask. \\n\\n- I started implementing a bit of game here and there…making an effort to be more dominant.   Amused mastery in my interactions with my wife, and women in general.  Even though losing the mother of my sons is really the last thing I want (she really is a stellar mother), I try to at least act in an outcome independent way with my marriage. I passed a few shit tests, and at one point essentially told her I would not allow her to talk to me disrespectfully.  Now they rarely happen.\\n\\n- I started telling my wife to do little things here or there for me.   I used to fear doing this and never did before, because it\\'s just not what nice guys do –  little did I know, what I wanted deep down was also what she wanted.\\n\\n- I took over our financials.  My wife had been handling bills and financial decisions throughout our marriage, and it often stressed her out. She was much more responsible than me when we first started dating/marriage, so it just made sense. But I did not like being without that control over our family, and I did not want to continue being the little kid managed by a mother.  So I told my wife that I was taking over bills, and that she needed to teach me the system.I told her this would be better for our marriage. She teared up with happiness.  It\\'s an easy thing for me, and she\\'s definitely less stressed.  \\n\\n- I’m working to eliminate “I’m sorry” from my vocabulary – something I would reflexively say about every little thing.  It\\'s a small thing, but it\\'s an easy weakness to eliminate. \\n\\n- Lost weight.  Just before finding TRP, my wife bought me Mark Sisson\\'s Primal Blueprint.  It\\'s legit.  I lost 40+ pounds, lost swelling from a gluten-based diet, and I have tons more energy.  \\n\\n- I quit being a self-conscious pussy in bed. And it\\'s the simplest thing: I do what I want or tell her what I want...I don\\'t ask. I love it, and so does she. \\n\\n- I\\'ve picked lifting back up, and I started dressing better.  I feel awesome, more confident, I get IOIs all the time, and my wife now constantly rubs up on my arms with do-me eyes.  \\n\\n- I joined a soccer team. It\\'s a game at which I completely suck, but I love competition. And I did not ask my wife to play...I told her I was playing.  Surprisingly (or not) she kind of liked the idea, something she would have never allowed in bluepill days. \\n\\n- I got promoted. Not really a result of TRP, but I\\'m able to appreciate it in a different way.\\n\\n- I rarely approach women, but I do things to remind myself it\\'s an option if I ever needed to.  I keep good posture, and make and hold friendly eye contact with attractive girls.  This often results in a double take or a smile...I don\\'t think most guys give good eye contact, but it usually gives the girl a little tingle and makes your cock grow three sizes.\\n\\nAs for my wife, she is noticably more calm and caring. She\\'s noticably more supportive, submissive and satisfied, and it\\'s how she wants to be.  She\\'s always been pretty, but she makes more of an effort now...either out of desire or dread or both, I don\\'t know.  She can allow herself to be more feminine. I know she is a woman with innate hypergamy that I need to be conscious of...but it\\'s a whole new world when it is directed at me.\\n\\nI still have much to learn and do, but thanks TRP',\n",

I met these two girls today and started talking to them for a while - one attractive, the other not. \\n\\nA bit later this guy comes in from Belgium - real in your face, immature, self absorbed dude.  What I had always perceived as the alpha , the bad boy.  I had been lurking for a while, so I knew there would be a power struggle, and I worked magic.\\n\\nThe guy was studying to be a doctor, and I used his strength against him by making sure the women in the room understood that he was far less mature than they wanted. That I was in control.  I would consistently put him down when he said ludicrous things, call him out on his shit and be frank and honest when I thought he was lying.\\n\\nPreviously, I would have just shut my yap and let him dominate the conversation.\\n\\nAt one point he led us on a wild goose chase to find a bar -- I literally saw a bar, said we\\'re going here, and he got mad.  One of the girls said \"well I mean someone had to lead and make a decision...\"\\n\\nYou could tell the we\\'re gravitating toward me.  It didn\\'t matter that he was more attractive -- I was the alpha. You could tell by how much he tried to make himself look better.  Distinctions in school. Royalty. Rich. I have no fucks in my assault on his ego -- I didn\\'t need his approval , or these women.\\n\\nAt the end of the night, I went to bed.  Why? Because I didn\\'t want anything  from these girls.  I\\'m sure that he got what he was after, but I\\'m also confident if I\\'d stayed he wouldn\\'t have had a chance. And sleep sounded better than sex, damnit.\\n\\nNo fucks man.

       "  'selftext': \"This is a long one, strap in. \\n\\nTo save the life story insert typical AFC beginnings. Before I swallowed I was a loner. I had no strong male friendships, no social circle, not even acquaintances. I was clinically alone. This amounted over time in high school to extreme misanthropy. Waking up and going to school (I’m now in first year university) was an aching tedium and seeing other peoples happiness was the slow poison.  \\n\\nSince swallowing, I honestly can’t quantify how much my life has changed. Today, I met up with a girl that I hadn’t seen in 3 months. When we first met, I spoke to her for an hour and flirted casually.  Went for coffee, came back to mine and made out with heavy petting. She was incredibly reserved, intellectual type of girl and a virgin, so quite reticent at first. She says no a few times coquettishly, yet I persevere until I have her quivering in my hands. Suddenly she pushes me away. \\n\\n“You’ve torn down all my mental barriers. No guy has ever done that, they always gave up when I said no”\\nI grab her by the waist and pull her close, looking deeply into her eyes. “I’m the kind of guy that sees something he wants and takes it” Commence level 10 tingles on the gina scale. \\nShe then proceeds to maul my face and at the same time rip off my clothes. \\n\\nThank you TRP. \\n\\nLast week, I met a cute older girl (21) on my birthday (19 years). I had a performance with my dance group (ethnic community stuff). I was largely in a shit mood and hung-over from the night before so my interaction with her was fueled principally by not-giving-a-fuck which led me to flirt and express my desire plainly to her. Post-performance the group went for dinner. She reciprocated the flirting. She grabs my leg at the table and starts stroking me over the jean fabric above my crotch. I get up to get a drink. She follows. She motions to go outside. Outside and some distance away from the restaurant I grab her by the waist and press her against the building whilst kissing her deeply. Despite it being dark and quite a discreet part of the town, people passing in the street turned and sneakily stared. They knew shit was going down. I continue until she is practically begging me to take her right there. We return to the restaurant and that night and the next, we proceed to text fuck each other until we agree on a time to meet. \\n\\nHer: “OMG. You're actually so sexy aha\\nThe way you grabbed me tonight PWO haha”\\n***\\n“The way you held me against you made me VERY turned on. very.\\nCan't wait to see what ur like NOT in public ;)”\\n***\\n“I wasn't sure you were interested until you started touching me in the car eheh\\nI’m glad you got closer” \\n***\\nAfter some serious dirty talk:\\n\\nHer: “you're going inside of me, because I can't deal with this flirting and dirty talk anymore. You need to fuck me. Hard.” \\n\\nTwo days later she comes to my house (I live 45 minutes away from her. Also, she has extremely conservative parents so it is under the pretense of visiting a girlfriend) and I proceed to fuck her like a wild bear.  \\n\\nHer: “you’re way better than my ex-boyfriend” \\nMe: “I’m always better than everyone’s ex-boyfriend” \\nShe goes fucking wild. \\nIn that afternoon I made her squirt seven times. Yes, she was a fucking squirter. She liked it rough and I gave it to her. \\nUntil that day, I was also a virgin. \\n\\nThank you TRP. \\n\\nYes, I’m bragging. Yes I’ve only written about getting with girls. However, the confidence I now have IS all ME. It is all due to TRP; the posters who share their experiences, their knowledge, their lives to help others. Thanks to Tomassi, Greene, Manson and Pook. Courtesy of the years of silent suffering and regret that I finally decided to eclipse with new conquest. Largely because of myself, and only myself, taking responsibility for my own happiness and path in life such that I will never again feel the same helpless suffering I pathetically drowned in. \\n\\nThanks to TRP I have recognised and seen myself in a dominant, sexually assertive and pervasively confident frame. That which I would never have believed I could ever hold previously. \\n\\nThank you. Thank you. Fucking thankyou. \\n\\nNote: My recent successes were not instantaneous. The learning curve over the last six months has been fucking harsh. I failed with LMR in bed with two girls, got grilled by super-feminist bitchy friends of another girl attracted to me (they were trying to ‘protect’ their friend) and had countless rejections and frame battering along the way. I know all of it was necessary to become the man I want to be. \\n\\n**TL:DR** Was a chump. Now I’m not. This is appropriate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKj4upY1VYI&amp;feature=kp\\n\\n**EDIT:** Current status: Spinning three plates, actively fucking two. Aced my first semester uni exams. Lively social life and developing friendships. Have a successful tutoring job, owner respects and trusts me greatly, leaving me in charge of business (60 students and 20 tutors) sharing responsibility with 3 other tutors.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I came here after a really bad breakup and was literally just googling ways to get over an ex. \\n\\nThe relationship was really good early on. I was a professional poker player making money hand over fist, I had a huge circle of friends and was the one that people called to find out what was going on every weekend, and I had been lifting for 2 years with a steady workout routine and good diet (6\\'3\"|210lb|10% body fat). Her and I started while I was in that mental head space. I was an alpha and never even thought about it.\\n\\nBy the time the relationship had dwindled, I had completely supplanted my friend circle with hers, I had quit working out, I was no longer playing poker professionally, and I was basically her bitch. I had lost myself to become everything she wanted. We fought all the time about pointless shit, I cried to her on multiple occasions, she had completely emotionally shut me out, and she eventually cheated on me several times, starting on my birthday of all fucking days. (Didn\\'t find out about the cheating until after the breakup)\\n\\nSo the googling began, I ended up here, began to read, and continued to read. Eventually the clock read 4am and I was so tired that I nearly passed out due to exhaustion. I woke up the next day and everything about what had happened in my last relationship was so incredibly clear to me in that mid morning haze. Every time we got into an argument about something, it was really a shit test that I had failed miserably. Every time I cried to her, she was secretly laughing at me. Every time we hung out with friends, they were her friends and she was losing respect because mine were gone. I was a complete beta bitch, and by the end of it she had more respect for the cockroach under her boot.\\n\\nNow at the time of the breakup (she left me for another man) I was completely broken, why did the woman who said she loved me so many times do this to me? I was angry, sad, confused, and heartbroken so it was easy to relate to these posts about women being useless, manipulative, and psycho. The posts about their mentality is what appealed to me the most and there were some misogynist comments that I felt myself relating to simply because of how I felt.\\n\\nNow it only took about a month of reading and introspection to fully move on. I had come to the realization that she was never being manipulative, she was just being a woman. It was I who had just failed at being a man. It was completely my fault that it all went to shit and coming to that realization has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. I am back in the gym (Not lifting but rock climbing now), I have most of my old friend circle back, I am now working at a place where i make good money, and my life is so much better off now than im sure it would be, and it\\'s all thanks to TRP.

       "  'selftext': 'My girlfriend knows my primary reddit username, so I\\'m using an alternate account for obvious reasons. \\n\\nI can\\'t believe this shit actually works. I was in a stale relationship with my girlfriend for about three years. We weren\\'t having sex except maybe once or twice a month, but I figured that it was normal for a long term relationship. She was a bitch, always complaining about me playing video games and not paying attention to her, but again I figured that was normal relationship stuff. Still, I was griping to my friend about it, and he told me to basically stop whining and check out the Red Pill. It opened my eyes, especially to the lies about rape culture and what it meant to be a man. I was so afraid of being a \"rapist\" and an \"asshole\" that I was powerless to take control of my relationship.  \\n\\nNow my girlfriend is anything but fat, but she\\'s always been sensitive about her weight. So I started pointing out heavier girls and making jokes about them, knowing that even though I wasn\\'t talking about her, she\\'d make it about herself. Her typical female solipsism kicked in, and all of a sudden she was desperate to please me. Now instead of bitching about me playing video games, she offers to give me head while I play! I don\\'t even turn off my mic while she does it.\\n\\nThe biggest success, and reason for this post, was when she finally let me give her anal. I use the term \\'let\\' loosely, because I threw that bitch on the bed and fucked her ass before she had time to say no. Previously she was one of those girls who said that she never, ever would try anal. I guess I changed her mind. She loved it of course and has been grinding her butt against me at night now, trying to tease me into fucking her there again. I finally feel like I have some control over my relationship.

       "  'selftext': 'I came with the wave of EMSK post to check TRP for myself. I admit that TRP was initially repulsive to me. I had been heavily manipulated before in a relationship and I didn\\'t want to subject someone to that sort of treatment. However I decided I wanted to see the subreddit for myself. I didn\\'t really disagree with anything you guys had to say, I\\'ve seen first hand some of the unpleasant realities you all point out. I had even noticed some of the traits you point out in provider males in myself. I have been seeing girl and she had noticed my more beta tendencies as well. She started to call most of the shots, ask me what I wanted to do and substitute her own ideas instead, shit test me constantly, play victim the minute I called her on any amount of wrongdoing, and started to lose her sex drive a little bit. I saw an opening to try some techniques and put myself in a different mindset tonight. \\n\\nPreface:\\n\\nI have a girlfriend now who doesn\\'t like it when I masturbate (because it lowers her value as you\\'d guess). She doesn\\'t even hide the fact that she wants to be the only release I get (like that will ever happen). So instead of hiding it, I text her this.\\n\\nME: [Pic of her panties she left at my place with jizz on them]\\nYou should have come over tonight instead (she was at her cousin\\'s)\\n\\nHER: I don\\'t know what to say right now...\\n\\nME: 30 minutes over here no bra. Bring chipotle. \\n\\n(at this point I though she was going to tell me to fuck myself)\\n\\nHER: What do you want\\n\\nME: [my order]\\n\\nthe next 30 minutes I got my chipotle, ate it and made her my absolute slut. The best part was her trying to get me away from finishing the food to fuck her. I stopped mid fuck to get up take another bite and start up again without warning. I did whatever I wanted, when I wanted and it drove her crazy (in a good way). She\\'s been \"marking\" me all night, hardly leaving my side. She\\'s going to come over tomorrow and make me dinner when we both get off work. I can\\'t imagine this working on everyone but my girlfriend really responded to TRP methods in a really positive way. \\nIt\\'s a dream come true. \\n\\nEdit: Speechless. Facepalm.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Last night I went out for a late night picnic and [star gazing](http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/). It went really well, but a buddy of mine kept sending me text messages and when I didn\\'t respond he asked \"You Fuckin?\". (wtf, I know) My phone was setup to show the first line of the message in the lock screen. As you can probably guess, she saw it and immediately asked \"what does that mean?, Is this what you do with all the girls?, you\\'re some sort of slut aren\\'t you\". I\\'ve changed so much since taking the pill so I don\\'t know what I would\\'ve said without it. Thank TRP for [shit tests 101](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/22qnmk/newbies_read_this_the_definitive_guide_to_shit/). Although she had a comical air about her, I knew there was more to it than that. I responded with \"yes. everyone. girls, boys, goats, dragons, fish, all sentient beings. I am captain Jack  Harkness.\" She caught the Dr. Who reverence and it immediately changed the subject. The whole night went like this. Amused mastery wasn\\'t something I had to force or learn. I found out that I\\'ve been that way with my little sister all along. Mix that with agree and amplify and you\\'ve got yourself a pretty cool BAMF. During the drive back, I mentioned something and she wanted me to elaborate. I didn\\'t want to and tried to changed the subject. What did she do? Tried to seduce me to give her the answer. While I was driving. It felt like a movie at the point. I held frame, turned up the music and we drove off into the sunrise. Thanks TRP. ',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Been married for 3 years. 2 years worth of it I was heavily involved with \"beta\" behavior. Arguments back and forth, consonantly failing shit tests. Sex was being withheld. I was constantly amazed on how it got to this point over 2 years. Add to the fact that I have 2 children with her.\\n\\nAbout a year ago I stumbled upon \"Goodlooking looser\". After exploring the rabbit hole even further I eventually came upon this Reddit channel. The arguments and threats of her leaving with the kids triggered something in me I suppose. I made a decision to stop acting like a pussy (I had nothing to loose at this point).\\n\\nFirst thing I did was lift weights with a vengeance. 3 times a week plus cardio. My position as a QA tester wasn\\'t enough for me, so I decided to also spend 2-3 hours every night teaching myself to code. I made an agenda of my own, I decided that any beta behavior from that point forward was unacceptable.\\n\\nAfter a few months her attitude started changing. I directed the family and became a leader. My wife and family was an extension of ME and followed the course that I would map out. Example of this change:\\n\\nHer: Lets go out this weekend. Me: Nope, I have to study, but I can make plans for the weekend afterwards. Her: We should head over to the theme park. Me: I don\\'t like that Idea, we are going to have some family fun and have a picnic at the park and then maybe head over to the mall afterwards. Her: oh ok. (her smiling)\\n\\nBefore I would have responded with: ummm this weekend is going to be kinda hard but i guess I can manage it. What do you want to do?\\n\\nHer: why does it seem like you dont care about your family yadda yadda yadda?\\n\\nIt seems that making your own plan and talking as if there is no other option in a super confident manner has a much better reaction than not knowing what do do.\\n\\nHer shit tests became easy to deflect, no longer was i sensitive to any playful insults. I would tell stories of women trying to flirt with me at the supermarket, her friends would compliment me on my \"nice body\" (I used to be a tad bit overweight.)\\n\\nTests would take the form of \"stories from her friends\" Her: So sad, my friends boyfriend was a good husband and she cheated on the guy, he was kicked out of the house and has to pay child support. Babe? what do you think about that?\\n\\nMe: haha. If I was him, and she cheated on me then I would be thrilled.\\n\\nHer: huh? what? why?\\n\\nMe: cause that means it\\'s open relationship time.I would offer an open relationship. If she declined then it proves she is selfish and thinks extra sex outside is something only SHE can do. Screw that!\\n\\nHer: what about the children?\\n\\nMe: ah! Well if she decided to leave anyway then it\\'s time to have double the amount of children!\\n\\nHer: are you joking?\\n\\nMe: nope. if a woman is going to have kids and then leave hoping to get child support. Then it\\'s time to have twice as many kids so that child support is so spread out-between all of the mothers, that they are barely getting 40$ each month.\\n\\nHer: ohh...never thought of that.\\n\\nThe subject was never brought up again. Swallowing the red pill has done amazing things.\\n1) She comes to ME for sex now almost every other night.\\n\\n2) flirting with me constantly like we are still dating\\n\\n3) \"marking me\" when we have sex out of nowhere since my six pack started showing. (hickeys bite marks etc).\\n\\n4) Subtle flirting from her sisters and cousins\\n\\n5) coming to me for permission to do things (total flip from when she used to demand)\\n\\n6) Respect from her in a fashion that I\\'ve never had before.\\n\\nThis has kept up for an entire year every since I changed my attitude. I wanted to thank you all.\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Swallowed the red pill at the beginning of the year after deciding my four-year relationship with my wife was dysfunctional (along with a majority of relationships before her). Overall application of principles has been great but I\\'ve had issues holding my frame when she wants to have a fight with me. After a decade+ of being the \\'appeasing peacemaker with the olive branch\\', I would hold frame in the beginning but I would eventually lose it just to get the fight over with. Until this week.\\n\\nWife started a petty argument and I held frame the first night and left go hang out with my friends. She was pissed, of course. Talked about \"running from conflict\" and all that jazz but I wasn\\'t going to play her games anymore. Let her cool off and fall asleep before I went to bed later that night. Next day, came home after work and she was clearly still wanting to fight. She eventually snapped on something petty again and went to the bedroom alone. I waited hours - watched a movie I had been wanting to watch, ate a fantastic dinner I had prepared for us both, played on the PC for a bit before getting in the bed and acting like nothing was wrong in the world. She hated it. She tried and tried to get me to cave in to her demands and wants but I held onto my frame throughout. I was getting to the point where I was just tired of her being a twat and considering giving in but at that moment - she started apologizing..... apologizing for starting petty fights and holding me to double standards. Talking about how she was feeling crazy and apologized for taking it out on me and expecting me to cater to her every need. It was as if the sky had parted and God himself was shining his beautiful truthfulness upon my bedroom....\\n\\nWe made up and made some very hot love. She got hungry and ate the dinner I had made for her earlier that night. She came back and said thank you and told me how good it was. I replied, \"it would have been much nicer hot off the stove with someone to enjoy it with\". She apologized again and we went to bed. I was giddy. \\n\\nThis woman has never apologized to me in a sincere manner in the history of our relationship. While RP principles have improved my relationship, finally holding frame throughout an entire fight is a huge accomplishment and I instantly felt a change in dynamics and energy with my wife. Woke up the next morning and felt that she looked at me in a totally different way. Since then, she has treated me with more respect and things generally have had a more even keel. \\n\\nI can\\'t thank TRP enough. I think this is a huge turning point for our relationship. For those out there who don\\'t hold frame - do it. Please do it. I don\\'t know why it works like it does, but it just works.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Occasionally in other, unrelated discussions simple-minded people will attempt to \"call me out\" as a RedPiller and use it as justification to dismiss whatever my original argument was.\\n\\nSo, here it is. If you want to get to the good stuff, just skip to the line break.\\n\\n**DISCLAIMER:**  \\nI\\'m a dude, I occasionally peruse and engage in conversations on TRP. I\\'m not a \"RedPiller\" because that would mean I would be subscribing to some ideology instead of thinking for myself, and independent thought is something that I am firmly committed to. In fact I\\'m so committed to it that if you ever catch me just parroting someone else\\'s ideas without reasonable justification, please call me the fuck out on that shit. Might be a chance for me to self-improve some more.\\n\\nAnyways, I come to TRP for the nuggets of useful information that exist there. I contribute where I can, both by agreeing and disagreeing with other users. One of the reasons I respect TRP is because it actually allows dissent, it doesn\\'t immediately ban users that disagree (something that I see as the internet-equivalent of putting your fingers in your ears and chanting \"la la la la la la la\"). Note that there is a difference between trolls and dissenters though, I am not opposed to trolls being silenced.\\n\\nI\\'ll be the first to say that TRP has a lot of ass-backwards ideas I don\\'t support, but I\\'ll also be the first to say that it\\'s often unfairly judged by those who are ignorant and incapable of entertaining an idea they don\\'t necessarily believe in.\\n\\nAs a final note to any dissenters, I was once banned from TRP for disagreeing. When it was decided that I was legitimate contributor and not just another troll though, the ban was lifted. You really can\\'t ask for a more respectable approach to content control.\\n\\n_______________\\n\\n**STORY:**\\n\\nAlright, so here\\'s the good stuff.\\n\\nI\\'ve been sleeping with this one friend of mine regularly for a couple months or so now. She\\'s sexy. She\\'s actually referred to me as \"alpha\" and many other guys as \"beta\", despite the fact that I\\'ve never used such language and that I don\\'t even acknowledge that whole alpha/beta dichotomy myself (I find it too restrictive to be applied well contextually).\\n\\nNow why might she say this? For one, I\\'m physical intimidating. I lift, I\\'m a fourth dan black belt in Taekwondo, and I\\'m of fairly large stature (currently at 5\\'11\" and 200lbs). I guarantee you her main *immediate* interest in me is my looks, she would have never even thought of me as a sexual being were I fat and/or weak. Now after physical attraction, there\\'s the mental/emotional. I keep calm in times of extreme stress, a gift resulting from a considerably fucked-up childhood. You could almost cut the attraction in the air with a knife a couple weeks ago when a drunken buddy of mine at a party started to pump his chest and try to instigate an altercation with me, while I just stood firm and calm and spoke to him as if nothing was different. I didn\\'t do that for the chicks though, I did that because he\\'s my buddy and I understand why he pulls stunts like that from time to time, I can\\'t demonize him for it.\\n\\nWhile I\\'ve already stated that I don\\'t acknowledge the whole alpha/beta dichotomy, if one were to describe me in TRP terms I\\'d probably be coined a sigma male. I\\'m not the loudest, nor the biggest, nor do I make any attempts to intimidate anyone. In fact, being raised by a violent, abusive, narcissistic father I have little patience or respect for anyone who tries to intimidate others.\\n\\nI\\'ve gotten slightly off track there, but I feel these details are important.\\n\\nSo, I recently went to a club with this girl to celebrate a mutual friends birthday. I\\'m going to take a second here to say that I can dance my face off, I *know* I\\'m sexy on that dancefloor. But lo and behold another girl was there - one that I hooked up with once before, however she sought me out as revenge against her ex girlfriend so it didn\\'t continue past that one night. Until of course I heard her mention an interest in the girl I had been hooking up with. I immediately mention to her that we\\'re probably heading to my place after the show and that she\\'s welcome to join us. Her response? \"That would be fun.\"\\n\\nFast forward through lots of dancing, drug use, and promiscuous fondling. We\\'re at my place. I\\'m not going to get into explicit detail but it was *damn* good. Really hot, so many new positions were available, and the action was never stale. I\\'m actually quite surprised with how natural it all felt as well.\\n\\nAnyways, next day they come over again, and of course we had lots of wild sex together. We\\'re all pretty on board that we want to make this a regular thing.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting here that these two women are sexy as hell, like model-quality hot. I\\'m not going to assign them a number because well, I found that whole number rating system juvenile even when I was a kid, I\\'m not about to start using it now. But damn these are women that a version of myself five years ago would have never expected any reasonable amount of attention from, let alone participate in a hot-as-fuck threesome with.\\n\\n______________\\n\\n**SHIT YOU PROBABLY DON\\'T WANT TO HEAR BUT REALLY SHOULD:**\\n\\nNotice that I referred to the original girl in question as my friend. Well that\\'s because she\\'s legitimately my friend, I\\'d be spending time with her even if we weren\\'t hooking up. I haven\\'t had to resort to being some sort of AlphaDouche asshole to get laid, I have abided by the same morals that I have retained my entire life. The second girl in question? We\\'re certainly friends now but not nearly as close. My main point is, I *do* show these women respect. I haven\\'t had to put women in a hole to take them off that pedestal. You *can* put them right at ground-level and have a healthy approach towards the opposite sex.\\n\\nA lot of guys are going to read TRP and think that being \"alpha\" means you have to beat your chest and kick ass and do all sorts of other shit. And well, you\\'re welcome to do that. It *is* actually an effective means of getting laid IMO, although only by the sort of women I wouldn\\'t care to sleep with myself.\\n\\n______________\\n\\n**Edit:** I realize now that my use of \"Omega\" may have been the wrong term to use, I meant whatever that sort of dude is that never appears to try hard but still gets attention. I\\'ll change it when I figure out for sure what the term is that I mean to use.\\n\\n**Edit 2:** As far as I can tel \"sigma male\" is the correct term for what I\\'m trying to describe, I have edited my post to reflect this.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Check my post history... my first post under this handle was about my dead bedroom.  Shortly after that post I stumbled across the Red Pill.  Now, a few short weeks later:\\n\\n- my wife is giving me BJ\\'s on a regular basis, and loving it, along with the various other activities we are both enjoying frequently\\n\\n- peace love and quietude rules our home, because of me.  Still working on my son, trying to get some red pill into him... that\\'ll take time.\\n\\n- I\\'ve been lifting, more than ever before, and results are starting to show, not just physically but also psychologically. I\\'ve always been \"fit\" due to lots of aerobic work, but skinny... so the bulked shoulders and chest are a big change in my look (and feel)\\n\\n- last night, went over to a gathering of friends, sort of a combo Father\\'s day get together, plus one of the wives\\' birthday, plus \"kids swimming pool party\".  Beers, burgers, cake, good times.  After a few beers I go inside the birthday girl\\'s house to find a bathroom, and she follows me. Shows me to the bathroom, says \"want me to join you\" ... her intent is unmistakable.  I decline, have to pee, close the door.  I come out, she\\'s still standing there blocking my way, demands a \"birthday hug\"  ... ok I give her a hug, then she\\'s all over me, trying to kiss me, hands everywhere.  Drags me out into the garage, closes the door behind us and finally I gave in and gave her a good red pill kiss and a nice squeeze on her ass, then slapped that rump and told her she\\'s a very bad girl and that\\'s all she\\'s getting from me.  Sent her back to her husband and kids in the back yard and I got the hell out of there.  \\n\\nPre red-pill, this (a) never would have happened, and (b) if it did I would have no idea why, what it means, and what to do about it. \\n\\nJust for the record, I am still married and have no intention of cheating on my wife, I consider what I did to be a birthday present for a friend.  She\\'s a classic case of blond, 5\\'4\" hotness, now age 40+, hitting the wall and needing some male validation.  \\n\\nThanks guys.  Mean it.  \\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'When I was introduced to The Red Pill in January through The Rational Male it went down extremely easy as everything that I had observed in human behavior suddenly made sense. At that point I had only slept with three women, a ONS, my ex-girlfriend that broke up with me in September, and another ONS on the rebound a few days after the break up. All done through accidental moments of dominance.\\n\\nAs an attractive, reasonably tall (6\\'1) man that\\'s usually socially dominant, I\\'ve always garnered a lot of female attention. But prior to TRP I didn\\'t know how to do anything about it. My only \"success\" with women came when I was almost black-out drunk, which meant that the black out was imminent and over the line behavior soon followed - like almost ripping off a girl\\'s bra in a club while making out. One night I smacked every girl that passed me on the ass as hard as I could and just kept walking as if nothing had happened. Another night I made out with five different girls, but was abandoned by each one. I was afraid to escalate, I was afraid to dominate. I was terrified to come across as creepy or even worse, rapey. I let the girls take charge and they lost all interest in the blink of an eye.\\n\\nAfter an adjustment period of ~1 month digesting what I have learned, I have in the past 5 months: \\n\\n * Gotten deep throated in a bathroom at a party\\n * Gotten approached by a ~HB7.5 at a club, and have her pay the entire cab fare of $75 to her place\\n * Gotten approached by a HB9 at a bar, whom I\\'ve converted into a zero maintenance FWB\\n * Picked up a tourist in a club with whom I had very rough sex (including ATM) in a park. Afterwards she told me she wanted to get fucked like that again and invited me to come visit her in the south of France\\n * Told HB9 FWB that we have to start using condoms again due to the above incident and we proceeded to have even better sex than before\\n\\nI\\'ve gone from guy who has gotten lucky only a few times in his life, who turned into a depressed beta pushover over the course of a multi-year LTR, to a guy who gets to experience the type of stories that my previous self would assume were made up.\\n\\nRegarding the last point, Blue Pill me would have assumed that sleeping with someone else would have broken some sort of tacit agreement with the FWB as we had been fucking for over a month, and would likely have lied to her and put her in danger of being infected with something just so I could avoid confrontation and the prospect of losing her. Instead I just told her that we needed to use a condom just as we were about to have sex, knowing I had done nothing wrong as we haven\\'t agreed on any commitment, and she just went along with it. Her only reaction was an incredulous \"are you serious?\" and a big smile that looked like it was trying to cover up hurt feelings, and she seemed even more attracted to me (if that was even possible) afterwards. Her reaction was basically textbook TRP.\\n\\nSo I\\'d just like to express my gratitude to The Red Pill. I haven\\'t had a single doubt about it\\'s core teachings since I found it, and it has rewarded me handsomely at every turn.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I’ve always been interested in pick up &amp; the social dynamics between men &amp; women. I’m 27, single and have battled depression all my life – the most intense phase has been the last 18 months. I’m unhappy, unfulfilled, confused and for all intents and purposes, just an average guy. \\n\\n\\nI knew of TRP before, but I properly discovered it through a thread that linked an imager album of how misogynistic TRP is. http://imgur.com/a/bGiiW\\n\\nAnd you know...I actually agreed with a lot of what was being said. Of course the album’s purpose is to highlight how TRP compares women to children and dogs but I entertained the message over the highlighted misogynistic thoughts for just a moment. I loathe the idea that women are almost “sub species” and I whole heartedly agree that there is some sexist bullshit going in those examples. \\n\\n\\nHowever, as I used to study pickup, I was intrigued enough to read on. I discovered that in all my successful past experiences, treating women as you would a child isn't as sexist, demeaning and counter intuitive as one might think at first glance. \\n\\nIf you take out the aspects of talking down to or patronising girls, suddenly everything falls into place. I constantly flirt with my female friends with the philosophy that I like to make them feel attractive and they like that – they flirt back. It makes perfect sense that whenever I’m doing that that I’m treating them like children to an extent. \\n\\nChildren need to be looked after &amp; lead. When you go into an interaction – making observations such as “I love that dress, you should wear it more often” they respond VERY positively. The idea of treating someone as you would a child is simply an exercise in how to be a leader in a relationship. Again to stress the point that talking down to or patronising is insulting and even very young people don’t like that. Even the statement of treating women like children is unacceptably condescending. But, this also now gives me tools to deal with someone throwing a tantrum.\\n\\nThe egalitarianism approach has not worked for the last decade of my life and I’m starting to think that **equality isn’t about splitting the bill, it’s about knowing your role and playing your part.**\\n\\nAfter reading the LTR Game Series, I thought more about TRP’s philosophy on life and applied to my own. If the red pill isn’t true then why...\\n\\n* ...when Amalie turned me down for a date and told me she goes for “Alpha” males, introduced me to her new her boyfriend Sam &amp; he threw a miniature tantrum, she talked to me all night instead?\\n\\n* ...when last night I got excited and displayed typical “beta” behaviour I got significantly less attention from Chloe.\\n\\n* ...when my girlfriend Charlotte repeatedly shut me down without words when I made advances towards her and I eventually called her out on her shitty behaviour, she changed it immediately. \\n\\n* ...when I discovered my parents marriage had been a wreck for the past 19 years there was a strong correlation with my father being a coward and my mother’s (and my) unhappiness. \\n\\n* ...when the concept of “shit testing” seems to hold true for every encounter I’ve ever had.\\n\\n* ...when saying goodbye after the cab ride home Lyndsay demanded a kiss on the cheek in front of a man she was currently seeing.\\n\\n* ...after a lovely day out in the sun, Amalie decided to hold me responsible for her sudden bad mood.\\n\\n* ...when I chose to lead and entertain 2 of my female friends at the arcade they stood there EXPECTING me to make their night more enjoyable and I enjoyed it.\\n\\nhttp://i.imgur.com/G5RrPJ3.jpg\\n\\nI’m still reading but things have changed for me now. Now I have a roadmap.\\n\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"So i posted here last month about discovering this sub and hitting the gym hard.  My life has literally turned 180 degrees around and it is pretty sick.  College friends I haven't talked to in years are calling me out of the blue wanting to hang out.  Girls are giving me compliments and I haven't even started bulking up yet, can't wait till I hit that point.  I recommitted to my personal finances, stopped being a lazy fuck, and now have a plan to be out of mommy and daddy's by the start of next year.  I also have a new plan recently conceived to start getting out of the house and meet new people.  Here are some ideas I've been toying around with:\\n\\n\\n- Buying a book off the r/fitness sidebar and following the plan.  Right now I just kinda guess good exercises with barbells and dumbbells and since I've started getting stronger I would like to follow a guide both to keep me focused and to improve quicker.\\n\\n- Find and attend local poker games.  I think it would be a great way to meet new people.  I'm a little concerned about seediness but I'll be ok.\\n\\n\\n- Learn to play the piano.  I haven't touched my keyboard since college and this self-improvement stuff has me really wanting to branch out.  All I need are some headphones so my parents don't go bonkers listening to me hit sour notes.\\n\\nThanks again, TRP!\",\n",

I was always wondering why hot girls are with jerks while I'm the one that respect them. I treat girls like I'm interested in their personality, give too much validation to them in exchange for nothing. I thought that any sexual interaction even touching her is unmoral because of religious society I live in.

I was thought its because of commitment and  marriage will solve this -hopefully I didn't try this!!:) .\\n\\nTwo years ago I found an strange thing!! Whenever I look to a girl and thinking about fucking her, she become interested to me! I didn't have any respect for her, she was just an slut for me, but it seems that she loves it! I tried this for some other girls and even older women, and as you guess, they all liked this!!\\n\\nI was confused, I didn't know which one is right, even I ask a female opinion about dating but it wasn't useful.

It wasn\\'t until I read No More Mr. Nice Guy that I really started understanding the realities of my situation and the way the world has changed. At least I\\'m blessed with enough introspection to see what I was doing right in the RP moments of my life and wrong in the BP moments of supplication and beta-jumpingflapjacks.

       "  'selftext': 'So I have to do this because I work with feminazis who know my actual reddit account. So hush, but I do look forward to the day when this doesn\\'t matter anymore. Anywho on with the tales of wonder.\\n\\nI never took the red pill by choice, or maybe I did. To put it simply, I was the poster child of the blue pill. Raised by my mother alone, taught to respect women, to do anything for a woman, and to just be a \"good\" guy to women.\\n\\nMy friend is the complete opposite, and I hated him for it. I thought he was abusive and all around just a horrible man. Calling women sluts and whores, and just randomly grabbing women that walked by him. He got laid, a lot. He pulls me and a few of his buds aside and tell us about the Red Pill, and how it made him who he was. I wanted nothing to do with that kind of rude and disrespectful behavior. It wasn\\'t right, right?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what made me come to red pill in the end. Maybe it was the gift of Pimp with Jullian my friend got me, or maybe it was this causing dread of being alone that got to me, but I finally came to the red pill. I was disgusted at what I saw.\\n\\nThe games women played on us all. How they acted, and so much more. An insight into a world I never knew was there, and me. Every subject regarding Beta males was there right in my face at ever turn. If beta was there, I had done it. So now we fast forward.\\n\\nI can count on one hand the amount of women I have slept with (well I use to be able to :D). As such I had always been fascinated by the female form and how women felt. On hindsight this was because I was so sexually starved that even a hug was too physical for me. Oh yeah, I was that kind of beta who would go to a club and everyone would be dancing and I was a stiff pillar of excitement. I shied away from most to all physical contact. Now this manifests in just plain I like how women feel. So I try to be more physical more often.\\n\\nI learned that my personality tends to be rather wacky. My friend who showed me red pill basically said I take people into a whole different universe of weird. So let me tell you about a particular event that made me realize how far the red pill had taken me.\\n\\nThe crew (all the men who study RSD Nation and Red Pill, basically 5 of us) do our pre-game. A shot of whatever and a trip to our \"den.\" At the \"Den\" we talk about our strengths and our weaknesses. We go over our game for tonight and try to nail down logistics on the women. Are we going for Day2 phone game, or we aiming for tonight? Then we hit our inner game. For each of us, it\\'s different. In my case I start amusing myself on everything. It was a game my mom used to play with me. It pretty much goes, \"how do you describe such and such thing if you didn\\'t come from Earth?\" So I start studying my surroundings as if this was my first and last day here on Earth. I watch as the women start dancing, and I look at the beverages and just enjoy myself giving zero fucks about what anyone says or does.\\n\\nThen comes the game. I have a bubble around me, anyone who comes into this bubble I talk to and open. On one particular night I had come across a women who was really cute. She was walking by and I grabbed her and began waltzing with her. By grab her I mean I raised my hand to high five her, she high fived me, but I kept her hand and then reached around to the mid of her back and began waltzing with her. She looked utterly confused. I told her that I believe it is traditional to dance and a club. She laughed. We got to talking, and she proceeded to shit test me, and this is where I lost it. I laughed a little and then pushed her away smiling. I said, \"Ah yes, the shit test. I had heard females do this some times. Don\\'t worry, I think you are a wonderful person and you don\\'t need to validate yourself. Don\\'t worry about, you\\'re cool in my book.\" She became flustered.\\n\\nI kept talking to her and listening to her. Eventually her friends came up to her asked who I was. I hushed them and picked up the girl I was talking to and rotated her 180 so her back was to her friends. I looked at her friends and said, \"Mine. My studies aren\\'t done yet.\" Then I dragged her to random places and did incredibly corny dance moves. The Lawnmower, the Shopping Cart, the Running Man, I had all the moves.\\n\\nSuffice it to say when the club closed she didn\\'t want to leave my side, but my logistics weren\\'t there so I got her number.\\n\\nI guess what I want to really say is that thank you Red Pill for giving me to myself. There\\'s no more social anxiety when I go outside anymore. I don\\'t think about people trying to hurt me, or that I might upset them. I can talk to women and not be stupid about it. This one is really important to me. So if it gets a bit deep, skip to the bold text.\\n\\nI sometimes thought that I was utterly worthless and that people would probably be better off without me in their lives. I would cut my arms and legs with knives or other sharp stuff to punish myself for being such a horrible person. I thought I deserved the pain and scars. I thought about killing myself so many times. I wanted to die and make people\\'s lives easier. Not any more. I wake up happy. I go outside happy. Every single day that goes by is a new adventure. I am doing to the world, not the world doing to me. I wish I could explain to you all the fog that was cleared from my head. I am truly happy God made me a man, and I thank every breath I take. I walk down the street with a smile on my face. Sometimes, I do that really embarrassing thing where you make yourself laugh but you don\\'t want to show so you make weird faces. That\\'s my life now. It\\'s fun and I wouldn\\'t trade it for the world.\\n\\n***TL;DR: Thanks, Red Pill, I have no doubt you saved my life. You gave me a chance to live again, and I can never repay what you gave me. Keep being awesome, and don\\'t drink my koolaid. It\\'s fruit punch flavored and the best. Hence mine.***',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I swallowed the red pill about 3 months ago.  I'm 3 years into a second marriage (I get steamrolled about not learning my lesson the first time, but this one has been much better).   \\n\\nThe wife is great at keeping the house clean, making meals, keeping up with the kids, and she's great in bed (sex still at least 5 days a week).  She's a registered obgyn nurse but since we moved way out in the sticks she hasn't been able to find a good nursing job, so she works part time at my parents' shop.   She's also a runner and has been doing great work running 4 days a week.   Now the issue with her is that her shit tests are sporadic, but very emotionally based (like most).\\n\\nThis morning after working my 13 hour grave shift, I crawled into bed at 9:30am, she came in kissed me goodnight and left to clean then go shopping for groceries.   I fell asleep very quickly, but after 45 minutes I was woken up by her patting my chest.  I was pretty deep into sleep but once I opened my eyes I saw that she was frowning and upset.   She said she was mad at me still.   The story was that during my brother's wedding, the weekend before, the photographer wanted pictures of the groom's family, but didn't ask for my wife or my brother's soon to be wife to be in the picture.  I didn't notice until after the pictures were taken that my wife was standing off to the side upset.\\n\\nI told her then that this wasn't about her, but she brought up that my mother never wants her in pictures (this is true, my mother is strange and possessive of my brother and myself).  I said I understood and to drop it.  But then she brings it all back up while I'm trying to get enough sleep for my next shift.  Instead of getting angry and breaking frame I A&amp;A'd her.   She started to cry and walked out of the room angry.   I was tempted to just fall back to sleep and let it go, but I wanted to nuke this and show her that her actions were not acceptable, so I got up, walked into the kitchen (where she was at), took the debit card out of her purse, and said that until she apologized for her behavior, that she was not going shopping, and that I was going back to bed.   She just stared at me with her big blue eyes.  I went back to bed and 5 minutes later she came in and apologized and made her sad face.   I lol'd, gave her a big kiss, ass squeeze, and sent her off to shop with the debit card.   Holding frame completely worked.\\n\\nAfter I woke up, and before I left for work, we had a great session in bed, and I dominated her while she came hard.   None of this would have been possible without the changing of my world view through the outlook of TRP, so this is just a long winded way to say thank you. :)\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'For opening my eyes. \\n\\n**This will be long but fuck it I\\'m Feeling Good. It will also be long because of how true all of the things trp talks about come to life when you start paying attention, when you are enlighten.** \\n   \\nIt\\'s only been a week and I\\'m already aware of all the warfare that is going. Warfare that I never was aware of. My personality is starting to change and even my voice has gotten deeper. I know its because of me being relaxed now. Prior to swallowing the pill my energy levels where through the roof for the wrong reasons. I wanted women to notice me. \\n\\nI had always been a standoffish guy because frankly, I was to scared to approach women. Women noticed that I didn\\'t show interest in them and flocked to me; what they didn\\'t notice at first was my anxiety. I was always surprised when a girl I thought was out of my league would try to get to know me. My problem was when the girls got to know me, I never sealed the deal. I never closed.\\n\\nI was so concerned with not coming off as creepy or rapey that I didn\\'t even flirt back. I look back now and see all the missed opportunities, if I only didn\\'t care what they thought. THEY CAME TO ME AND I STILL DIDN\\'T WANT TO OFFEND THEM. Fast forward to last week there are these two sisters who I\\'ve always been an asshole to. I didn\\'t give a shit if they liked me or not, but we had a mutual friend in common. Eventually we would all be together in a group talking to one another and I got more comfortable with them. \\n\\nShit we talk occasionally so I might as well be nice to them maybe I should start saying Hi to them. (Mind you prior to this I always ignored them and they did like wise.) I started saying Hi to them occasionally because I wanted to be nice and get practice with being friendly to women. I should be nice to them after all they are girls...Crazy how you dont think that way about guys.\\n\\nFunny shit is...they looked down upon me, they never said it verbally but I felt it. I felt them thinking they were greater than me, here I was trying to be nicer and these two thought I was some orbiter. (I should also note that these two get alot of attention from other guys).\\n\\nAfter swallowing the pill I said fuck all that noise. These two always walk right past me. I\\'m one approaching them they never approached me once. Then a lightbulb went off. I\\'m going to ignore them. I\\'m going back to my old way\\'s just to see how they will react.\\nRight on queue I felt their glances, it was like being hit with a lazorbeam. I walked by them and didn\\'t acknowledge them, didn\\'t even look their way. Prior to swallowing the pill I thought I was being an asshole by doing this but now I know. I know my worth, its fine if you don\\'t wanna talk to me, keep it moving honey there\\'s plenty of girls out there.\\nWhy stop there? I did it to ALL the women that knew I checked them out, all the women I would turn my head around to see. Guess what, in only one week I practically got them begging for my for attention. They want that validation, I\\'ve gotten more attention by not giving any! go figure. Its only been a week and I\\'m well aware of all the shittest\\'s I\\'ve been failing. No more free validation you don\\'t owe me anything and I damn sure don\\'t owe you anything as well. \\n\\nI was first introduced to how women are back in 3rd grade. I remember I wasn\\'t the coolest kid but I was the coolest kid best friend. There had been this girl who would go back and forth between us. One day she flat out told me When X isn\\'t here you\\'re my boyfriend but when he is here I\\'m his girlfriend. That kind of logic didn\\'t comprehend in my mind so I ignored it. Then somewhere along my way I started to fear girls not because of them being girls but because I didn\\'t want to offend them. It was always about them, all of my problems came because of them. When you start to not care about them, they start to care about you, crazy huh? \\n\\nAs I read more about theredpill I became angry, angry because how dare women. How dare them cheat on a \"great guy\" that provides for them and takes cares of them for a guy who didn\\'t give two shits about them. Then it hit me, women are opportunists. THEY HAVE THIS SHIT DOWN TO A SCIENCE. You cant be mad at them for being like that, its how they are.\\n\\nCase and point my friend had this girl on the side for a bit. I thought nothing about it because I didn\\'t know she had a boyfriend, nothing wrong with a little fun. My friend is well off, his life is great but he is also aware of the shit women pull. The girl cheated on her boyfriend because if she can get with my friend she will be way better off than with her current boyfriend. She stuck with her boyfriend as a backup plan BUT got kicked to the curb. The pedestal I gave her (unknowingly) was also kicked to the curb when we all saw each other and she walked by us; as if we didn\\'t exist. Damn, cant even say bye to the guy that dicked you down? \\nI\\'ve been rambling for too long so here are some points I\\'ve learned in my first week with TRP\\n\\n-Don\\'t hold ANYONE higher than you; especially women. **Especially** the ones you barely know. \\n\\n-Don\\'t get mad at women for being women. They cant help it and neither will you if you\\'re all mad about it. \\n\\n-Embrace the game and learn how to play; don\\'t be the chump she left, be the guy she left the chump for.\\n\\n-The less you care about them, the more they care about you. Don\\'t just act that way guys, you actually have to feel this way. Women have this sixth sense that can smell even the tiniest of insecurities. Wanna know when a women is losing interest and respect for you? look at her eyes. When her eyes go from being [excited] (http://i.imgur.com/cchvky6.jpg) to [this] (http://imgur.com/FgfmJGe&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;NmZo5ni#0), Its over. She\\'s figured you out, Abandon Ship. (Obviously it\\'s not always the case, especially if you\\'re maintaining frame, but if you aren\\'t she\\'ll sniff right it out.)\\n\\n-Don\\'t take yourself too seriously let loose, relax, Life is short enjoy it. \\n\\n-Don\\'t start shit and don\\'t take shit.\\n\\nIn the end of the day what you learn at Theredpill doesn\\'t apply just for women, [Nah] (http://i.imgur.com/moJWxsM.jpg) that\\'s just the tip of the iceberg.\\nBe successful out there guys. Know Your Worth. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"So, I was out drinking with my best friend and couple other guys. We drunk a lot, but I was feeling great. After it we just went around the city talking to people we knew and fooling around. \\n\\nWhen we got bored, we saw a group of younger people (all 17-18) with a lot of girls and some guys in it. We didn't know anyone but we somehow opened the group and started talking with one girl. One of the guys jokingly said 'man I need to fuck' and the girl answered 'I have a lot of nice friends I can call'. We told her to do it and finally convinced her to introduce us to other girls in the group. Then the need of more alcohol kicked in and after small talking we decided to go to the liquor store. I grabbed two girls I just met and hugged them and walked with them by my side (don't know any good word for it in English, I am ESL. [I mean this](http://www.electricfeast.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/the-series.jpg)) \\n\\nOne of them was actually a very cute girl. I noticed it and left the other girl go but grabbed this one hand and introduced myself. She was very receptive and smiled a lot. We continued to walk by hand. I don't want you to bore you too much, but this easy and aggressive way helped me get a girl in like 10 seconds. No escalation nothing. We were holding hands and hugging all the time.\\n\\nThen of course her 'friends'. All trying to push her away from me. I let her go once but she came back, and then when her friends came again I told 'Stop! She's mine now' and grabbed her by her butt and run away laughing. We kissed a little but her friend were really fucking annoying.\\n\\nAs I now reminded myself, we must have pissed the guys that were out with these girls. There was 2 of us stealing 8 girls, but when I took care of one girl and my friend wasn't interested in any of them they soon went home. \\n\\nAnyway, TRP is the shit, I fucking love you guys.\\n\\ntl;dr I didn't know the girl, I just put my hand on her shoulder for a sec then introduced and after shaking hands I kept holding her hand.

       "  'selftext': 'Things were never easy for me growing up. I was diagnosed with Nonverbal Learning Disorder very early in life.  NLD completely alters the way you learn and interact with people, so socializing was an uphill battle for me.\\n\\nThings took a turn for the worst when I hit middle school. As my condition made my school work suffer, I was given many different accommodations to attempt to help me out. These mortified me, as I didn\\'t want to be stigmatized by my peers. So I withdrew from as many social situations as possible. So as puberty hit, I was completely unable to talk or interact with the girls I was suddenly becoming interested in. \\n\\nMy parents didn\\'t really help either. My dad is a pretty beta dude himself, and never had the balls to give me the talk. I learned about sex from Google, after being tired of having no idea what my friends were talking about. \\n\\nWhereas the NLD killed my human interaction, the increased verbal skills led me to develop skills as a self-proclaimed \"cyber-pimp.\" I took all the things I didn\\'t have the stones to say in person, and sent them to girls on chat rooms and dating sites all around the country. I was sent countless nudes from girls who I didn\\'t have to talk to, and had a couple internet girlfriends in high school. I couldn\\'t figure out though why I couldn\\'t make it work in person.  \\n\\nMy senior year, I finally got my first real-life girlfriend. And oh lord did the beta pour out of me. I backed down in every fight we had. I constantly let her boss me around. I was so happy to finally have an actual girlfriend, I figured it was something I had to put up with. The only thing I got out of the relationship was that I didn\\'t have to graduate high school as a virgin (made it by 3 days). \\n\\nWe didn\\'t last long after I went to college. I don\\'t know if she cheated or not (she probably did), but I know for a fact her and another guy were showing interest in each other while we were still dating. We broke up in October of 2010. The rest of my freshman year of college was spent locked up in my dorm room playing video games.\\n\\nMy sophomore year, I joined my college\\'s drumline. I met a girl there, and fell head over heels. After leading me on, she told me she just wanted to be friends. I got oneitis really bad. I was completely unable to function. It was made worse soon after. She started finding heroin needles in her apartment, and I had an open room in mine. I invited her to take it, somehow thinking this would change her mind. On the contrary, she started dating some guy 10 years older than her. He would visit, and I would have to spend my evenings listening to the love of my life get railed. \\n\\nFinally, after over two years of the same oneitis case, a friend of mine posted a link to a Return of Kings article on Facebook. I read it. Then I read the whole website. And then I found /r/TRP. I took everything in I could. I got over all the oneitis and all the beta tendencies. It was life changing. The main thing it gave me, was that I was able to embrace my NLD for the first time, after denying it all my life, without using it as a crutch. \\n\\nBasically, my TRP journey is still in its infancy. I have so much to learn and put into action. I\\'m working out vigorously this summer. I have one semester of college left, and I plan to use it to put all this learning into action. But regardless, I\\'m happier, I\\'m more confident, and my oneitis is history. \\n\\nSocializing will always be an uphill battle for me. But TRP is the first thing that\\'s ever given me hope.

What a year..  I went through the divorce, through being single, the death of a parent, and a few girlfriends.  countless one night stands, dates from pof, okc, tinder.. god I love tinder..  \\n\\nChallenged myself to approach, night and day.  found day game much easier than night game.  then found night game much easier than day game.  \\n\\nworked out, lost a bunch of weight, gained some back, then lost it again.  doing pushups and situps daily..  will never look back.  from size 42 to size 36 jeans...\\n\\nAside from everything, is the fundamental respect I have for myself.  It is not even all about women, but that is nice..  it is about the fact that no one disrespects me.  My kids see that, and they love it.  I love that they look up to me.  That I have 4 women that want more commitment from me than I am willing to give them, and they all look up to me.  That I can flirt everyday if I wanted, or sometimes just don\\'t give a shit.  That I am not lashed down by anyone\\'s expectations of me.  That I trust myself to handle what life gives me, and that by doing so, life gives me some pretty good stuff.  \\n\\ncareer wise, I am having the best financial year of my life.  I received three promotions last year, and am on target for a 250 year.  \\n\\nI have not faced my fears and won, I have learned to embrace my fears and my anxieties and by doing so realized that there is nothing that can stop me.  I have no desire to be anyone else..  not some rockstar, not some movie star, not some athlete..  I am me, and that contains more power than I can convey in words.  \\n\\nI cannot give rp all the credit, I learned from many places along the way, but this place was and continues to be a fundamental place that contributed to the mindset changes needed to become who I am today.

I always said I would dump her right if it happened, but it took me some time before I could come up with the resolve.\\n\\nI've always had my life in check, except that one last year of my shitty relationship. My next relationship was short lived; I was too bp. WAYY too bp. I saw how I destroyed the life of my ex, and I didn't want that, so I started to cater to my ex's wants. Lets just say that relationship sort of scarred me since I was so unprepared as a teen to deal with it. For the last few years I have been single, but there have been plenty of opportunities that women have thrown at me, but I just deflected it since I wasn't sure if it was what I wanted and the BP was strong in me.\\n\\nBut now, TRP has woken me up from that slumber. I was introduced to PUA last year by my friend, and I already thought it was stupid. Why would you tell a girl she's cute as an opener? Give her all the power? What a joke.\\n\\nIve noticed that women have always been attracted to my stoicness, calmness in situations, and my drive and passion for my future career and life. I started working out two years ago and lost a handful of weight and now I have joined a boxing gym to hone my reflexes and body even further.\\n\\nI want to thank TRP for this breathe of fresh air, away from all the bullshit beta guys that I've had to put up with.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Folks,\\n\\nThis is my first contribution ever and I am using it to thank the TRP community:\\n\\nThrough the application of a mindset focused on continuous self-improvement, I have grown immeasurably over the course of the last year. \\n\\nI freely admit that I have always been a man who sought validation at every turn and this has historically made me vulnerable to the particularly heinous emotional trauma that goes along with losing the favour of a significant other. Like many others I came to this community angry, chagrined, and desperate for answers as to just what in the fuck is wrong with women and how could I better prepare myself to deal with them. \\n\\nWhile I still find women to be incredibly difficult creatures, my overall success rate has improved and I have become far better at accepting rejection when it does come. True satisfaction that comes from within can’t be taken away from you at somebody else’s whim. \\n\\nThe Reward:\\nI am currently enjoying the exciting initial stages and sex of a fledgling relationship with an extremely accomplished woman who is an easy 9/10. The level of engagement, passion, and mutual attraction is something that I have never really felt before…. and I am in the driver’s seat. I can safely say that this would never have happened if I had not committed myself to getting better.\\n\\nI am still choking on the pill but the insight and motivation that I have gained to date has been life-altering for the better. I will close this with some words of advice that we’ve all heard before but are worth repeating:\\n\\n-You know that nagging in your mind always telling you to make more friends? Pick up another hobby? Start a business? Kiss the girl? JUST DO IT. Even if you fail, you have learned from the experience and the satisfaction of just having tried WILL feel good.\\n\\n-Although lifting seems to be gospel around here, I would extend this to cover fitness in general. It is completely unacceptable to be a sedentary slob. We are men, we are built for destruction, fucking act like it! I promise that your life will improve.\\n\\n-Surround yourself with similarly motivated people and develop each-other. The positive feedback loop of good feels WILL improve your life.\\n\\n-Porn and video games have the potential to hold you back from greatness.\\n\\n-Do and excel at things for the love of doing them, not because you think it will make you more appealing to women.\\n\\n**Thanks!**',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Fuck the blue pill bullshit I've been my entire 24 years of (so far wasted) life. It's time to swallow and not gargle.\\n\\n\\nI discovered TRP about a week ago and literally spent 6 hours reading top posts of it and the RPN, and have since been reading more every day. Its like the Matrix where I'm vomiting trying to deny it, but the evidence is infallible: we live in a feminist world where men are expected to be weak emotional pussies. In order to rip my dick from the gaping hole that is between my legs I must \\n\\n\\n- get ripped \\n- get confident \\n- get social\\n\\n\\nA little about me: I grew up in ultra-Christian deep south, everyone who believes evolution is going to hell, yadda yadda. I lost my faith about 14 years old listening to hiphop and from there things progressed pretty quickly. Being rebellious to the Christian girls was like the most attractive quality you could have so I had a lot of flings and STR's til I met a unicorn when I was 16. For two long years she had me as her lapdog literally willing to do anything as long as she would fuck me nonstop. Of course she eventually got tired of me beta ways and dumped me for my best friend, who, coincidentally, now drives a Benz and lives in Hawaii with unlimited pussy access. Instead of realizing he, while flawed, was definitely taking life by the horns I inserted my tampon and became bitter, victimized etc. I tried to date fellow college girls before I graduated but I was so bitter against women in general and I couldn't figure out why so many of them were literally willing to fuck ANYTHING WITH A COCK. Instead of joining a frat and learning social skills, I spent my first three years of college with beta friends all putting pussy on pedestals. Then I got an internship so my final year was spent working, studying, and dealing with video game addiction (it was bad). All the while any girl that batted an eye I immediately would assume my place in the line of orbiters. Oh, did I mention I also managed to white-knight on multiple occasions? Everything you can do wrong I HAVE DONE.\\n\\n\\nWhich brings me to this last two years. My internship turned into a full time position but I was overconfident and lazy and managed to get myself fired, rightly so. Then I got a job in sales because, like women, the first job that came my way I opened wide and took. Making all commission my finances dropped pretty quick, especiallysince the girl I was orbiting at the time offered my her sweet 20+ partner-having pussy in exchange for free rent and lap dog services. I gleefully accepted thinking about how having sex again would solve all my problems. Wrong. I got into severe credit card debt, got evicted, had to sleep in my fucking car some nights until I finally waved the white flag and moved into my parents house. This was one year ago. Since then, I have talked to zero women, have no friends, and can't even discipline myself enough to profit consistently at 10NL online poker, which is literally the only thing in life I feel like I could do if I could just get my head out of my ass and get motivated.\\n\\n\\nEnter the red pill. Holy shit omfg. I am a vacuum and the content is rushing into me and its so damn obvious and simple. The solution to all my problems: become a man. It has been building all week until tonight, when I finally throw down the gauntlet and resolve I WILL: \\n\\n- get my fat white whale ass in the gym \\n- stop eating shit food (I'm looking at you, McDonald's) \\n- Exercise every day, gym or not.  Take a walk, do some pushups, etc. \\n- Post results consistently (once a month, maybe?)\\n\\n\\nSee ya at the gym, guys.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I have been lurking on TRP for four months now. I put off creating my first post for a long time because I wanted to make sure that the theories I were reading and the material I was combing through hours a day would actually work. I wanted to be able to know what I was talking about when I finally made my leap into TRP community. But lets get on with the thank you note.\\n\\nMy journey began actually about a year and six months ago, long before I discovered TRP but my experiences back then were essential to me realizing the truth of the nature of women. Me and my girlfriend of the time had been dating for nearly **three years** when we both moved off to college together. Things were rocky for the first couple of weeks which I had anticipated, change is hard on everybody after all. We were both music education majors and in marching band together. About a month in she began to show a lot of attention to this guy in the band. I was naturally suspicious of their interactions but tried to not let it bother me because I was still taking in the awesome that was college. A few weeks down the road after this, she tells me that she has feelings for him, so I do what I thought at the time was the most rational action and break it off with her. After all, if she really was in love with me like she said then she'd come back right? Well actually she did, she came back begging for me after less than a week. And for the next week or so she seemed so incredibly happy to be with me and I thought the matter was settled. **NOPE**.\\n\\nAfter another week or so, she began acting the same way as she previously had and I knew exactly what was happening after this point so I did again what I thought was the most rational thing and sat her down to talk out our relationship problems one by one (I think you can see where all this is leading). Finally she admits that she never stopped having the tingles for this guys and I tell her to make a choice. She says she *can't*. So I get up, and as I'm walking out I say, *You've already made it.*\\n\\nThe next couple months I spend all of my energy trying to get her back even though *I* was the one who walked away from it. I had oneitis hard core. Finally we end up parting ways, she moves in to live with the guy, gets married, and has a kid. I move back to my home town and begin **drastically** changing my life style. I start working out, start eating better, start reading on self improvement (No More Mr. Nice Guy, The 48 Laws of Power, The Way of Men, The Power of Now, etc.) and now I'm going to be a supervisor in a couple of weeks and have had more relationships in the past few months than I've had in the entire rest of my sexually active history.\\n\\nBut all of these things compounded when I discovered TRP. It was my missing link to all of the questions that went unanswered.\\n\\n&gt;How could she leave me, her boyfriend of **3 years** for a guy she's only known for **3 weeks**?\\n\\n&gt;He's some country bumpkin that will never amount to anything. How can she be attracted to him?\\n\\n&gt;He's at least 50 pounds heavier than I am, how could she even start having sex with him?\\n\\nEnter TRP. I became obsessed with reading the side bar material. I soaked it all in. I spent hours a day in January of this year lurking and reading. It all made so much sense to me. I couldn't understand why it was so taboo. I had proof that it worked in my own life! Dread game, negging, shit tests. I had experienced all the effects of these terms but never knew what to call them. **It. Made. So. Much. Damn. Sense.**\\n\\nSo here I am now. 230, muscular, great job, no longer an incel after nearly a year, and I have all of you to thank. So thank you.\",\n",

Overall, I wouldn't have gotten so close if not for the RP and another lesson I've learned is that I need to cut off people like my roommates from my life.  They, like me, are virgins,  but they made no effort to change themselves and have become jealous of me, seeing me as an asshole because I don't bend over backwards for girls and because I made the mistake of making my rp philosophy known early on. \\n\\nEdit: I had texted them around 1.5 hours earlier to leave the room because we had had a roommate agreement that if either one of us was going to get laid, then whoever was in there would leave.

       "  'selftext': \"So yeah I've been lurking for a while and I gotta say some, if not most, of this stories have made me relate in some way. I've never been something more to a girl I really like but a friend or just her ATM, after a lot of red pill posts, I've realized what a fool I've been (after this many years it took a subreddit to make me realize it, but I digress). Here's my story (one of many): \\n\\nI was in high school and by the last year this hot as fuck girl started treating me right and shit, so I just fell head over heels for her, doing what she wants of me, be it her homework, taking her to meet her friends, without me staying with her, buying her all kinds of expensive shit, taking her to restaurants whenever she wanted etc.. \\n\\n1 year after that I kept doing the same shit without even getting a kiss from her, then I found out she had a boyfriend of 5 years, so basically I did what a fucking beta would do, I kept at it for 1 more year hoping she would dump the guy for me. \\n\\nSufficient to say the thing ended when she dumped me (because according to her we where dating that whole time, she even told her friends and they told me, that if I had the balls to tell her to dump her boyfriend she would've become my girlfriend and shit). \\n\\nAfter I started to read the red pill my perspective of things changed a shit ton, anyway, 2 years ago I met her again on a high school reunion, ( I spent those 2 years focusing on me and improving myself). I didn't even look at her at first but she kept trying to talk to me and shit and I felt that beta pull me in, but I didn't let myself become that guy again. \\n\\nI talked to her like I would any other girl after reading the red pill, I took her home, fucked her brains out, and now she keeps nagging me for dates and shit, of course I don't go out with her, now I'm way over her league. \\n\\nThank you redpill for helping out a bro. \\n\\nTL;DR met a girl in high school, was her beta slave for 2 years even though she had a bf. Met her a couple years later after taking red pill advice, fucked her, dumped her, now she wants everything with me. \",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hey everyone,\\n\\nI just wanted to share a realization I just had. I recently ended a LTR with a girl I thought I was going to marry. One night when we were out celebrating a friends birthday at a bar my ex and I got into an argument. It was the first time we had gotten into a pretty serious one too, little squabbles here and there, but nothing like this.\\n\\nNow normally in the past, especially with confrontation, I would just apologize (even if it wasn't my fault), kiss her feet, and pretty much go beyond what was needed to make her happy again. However this night felt different. I had discovered TRP a few days before this event and vowed to become more of a man this time around and not be such a doormat.\\n\\nSo when this argument started becoming heated, instead of apologizing, or bending over backwards, I just stopped. I literally just stopped arguing with her. I asked the bartender for the tab, paid, and told my girlfriend that I was leaving and I will talk to her when she's calmed down. Luckily, we were with her brother and friends so it made this decision to leave her much easier for me.\\n\\nShe sat there in shock with a dumbfounded face when my words and actions sank in. I was pretty angry with her behavior and I let it show, something that I had never done before. When I started getting my belongings she started pleading with me to stay. It was like a switch inside her was flipped. She quickly started to apologize, almost teared up, and started becoming more affectionate when I did decided to stay.\\n\\nAs the night went on it's like her behavior did a complete 180 and she started to act like the girl I originally fell for. Even her brother and his friends seemed to respect me a little more - like the occasional teasing stopped and they even bought me a shot.\\n\\nThe best part about this night was that when we went back home, we had some of the best sex of my life! She was turned on and already wet before we even got to the car. She told me in the morning that it was the best sex she ever had. I was able to do things with her I never could before, (she was kind of a prude before this). After that night I was hooked on becoming more dominant!\\n\\nI also started to see all the flaws in the relationship, albeit I blame myself and my BP ways for them, but it was like swallowing the right pill this time truly opened my eyes.\\n\\nSorry for the format and if this sounds like bullshit or whatever, but it's what happened and it is what got me subbed to TRP.\\n\\nJust wanted to share it with you guys, take care.\\n\\nEDIT: I am glad to see that my experience is making it's way around. I'm glad to know that I am not the only one who has had experiences like this and I am even happier to see you guys sharing some knowledge in order to make us better men. I use to shun this subreddit, and man what a fool I was. Listen to me if you are still on the fence about accepting this philosophy - JUST TRY THESE IDEAS ONCE - just fucking once and I guarantee you will see a positive difference.\\n\\nEDIT II\\n\\nTL;DR In relationship that was making me unhappy. She embarrasses me at bar, had RP theory in my brain for first time. Try it, it works wonders. Didn't fully swallow it so flip flopped between BP and RP. Finally went full RP. She didn't like it, can't say I blame her. She got use to BP me, liked RP me, then RP me disappeared. I don't blame her, all me. Should have been RP from start. This stuff works, and not just with women. \\n\\nAlso I originally posted this on the main subreddit. I just copied and pasted it over her. \\n\",\n",

I have done that, and since Sunday, the hamster has been going crazy. Already have received two massive texts, and today I check my Facebook to find the longest message I ever have received. It was 500 words! To paraphrase, she said that I deserved \"closure\" and how shitty of her it was to do it through text. But she still is wanting me to succeed in life.  She also went on to say that she wanted to experience different men(ride the carousel) and confirmed tons of red pill truths. Funniest thing there, was that I shouldn\\'t completely cut her out of my life, we were best friends like a week ago..... Fuck that noise. I am already over it, and heading out tomorrow night with a cute girl I know from school. Also haven\\'t felt this free in a while. Thanks for the advice and encouragement gentleman.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I know I say this every post, but I just want to provide context. I got out of a 10 year sexless relationship (go read my whining over at dead bedrooms to get the idea).\\n\\nI\\'ve been following some of TRP for about a month now. The advice here for men is just in-fucking-valuable! I\\'m amazed it\\'s free. I had a semi indirect confirmation that what I\\'m doing is good yesterday. Twice in fact.\\n\\nIn the last 2-3 weeks, I\\'ve altered my workout from straight cardio and rather aimless weight machines (was never sure what they worked, I just did them) to include a proper lifting regime and I\\'m already feeling ten times better. No supplements or any of that crap - though someone convinced me a whey protein shake was good after lifts. I\\'ve started on those, but don\\'t feel much different. This is my current regime:\\n\\nhttp://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/shaun--s-3-day-muscle-building-split.html\\n\\nI was given this by a TRP member. I doubt he even realized he went to the trouble of pasting a link. But I\\'m, glad he did. Apart from having to deal with the chodes who oil themselves up before workouts (I mean really, WHY do they do that? They only seem to admire either themselves in the mirror or the other dudes... for real!) \\n\\nBut, I\\'m having way more fun working out and I am noticing results. My coworker mentioned it to me yesterday. He said that I was really kicking some weight off and looking far more toned (I wear t-shirts to work). I spent lunchtime giving him (probably the worst ever) diet and workout advice. But it\\'s nice to know that someone noticed enough to actually want *my* advice and even go to the trouble of double checking some stuff.\\n\\nSecond confirmation. I went speed dating Saturday. Long story short, met a girl there, but she stood me up on a date Wednesday, so I intend to just plate game her. And I\\'m slightly happy that I don\\'t give a shit whether or not it works! In a way it was a good thing as it reinforced that the last thing I need after such a shit long term relationship is yet another shit long term relationship! Doing my thing and random girls is just the ticket I think!\\n\\nBut, last night I was at a concert. I decided on the way there that I needed to put more TRP theory into practice. One thing I had heard is \"make at least one approach every day\". Combined with \"never fear rejection, there are worse things\", I reminded myself of an incident as a teenager. I got mugged, was stabbed by the mugger, spent 16 weeks in hospital and almost hemorrhaged to death. That I feel is my little reminder, extreme though it is, that there are worse things than getting rejected by some girl! \\n\\nSo I\\'m chilling and watching the opening bands. Now, apart from the speed dating girl which in my mind doesn\\'t count as a cold approach, I\\'ve not cold approached a girl in 10 maybe 11 years! Even then, I don\\'t think I did much of it. But nothing like starting at the beginning! \\n\\nThis took a little more bottle than I gave it credit for, but I did it anyway. After one of the support bands finished, I saw a girl chilling out. I realized after a bit that she was there on her own. This I immediately thought is my chance to practice my approach. OK, not ideal as there were no friends to cockblock, but I just thought really, what\\'s the worst? She\\'ll tell me to piss off and I\\'ll go watch from somewhere else. No big deal.\\n\\nThings went off better than expected. We talked, though there were some slightly awkward silent moments but largely excused by someone testing a mic. But, we were both there alone and enjoyed each others company. \\n\\nI initiated body contact too. We had a little groove together and after I led her out with arm contact. OK, I didn\\'t feel entirely natural doing it but she didn\\'t draw away and I put it down to my total lack of experience touching another human (I told you my LTR was dead bedroom, right?). But practice is practice. \\n\\nShe wanted to go for a quick drink after. I went to pay but she insisted on giving me some cash. To put into context, she was a student, knew the pub was expensive so by giving me cash, she either recognized that it was pricey, or she was making clear that this was a friends thing. Like I say, I was more after the practice and felt a little bad about taking her money but she really insisted. She had to leave for her bus after that. I made sure to re initiate contact by leading her out and she didn\\'t pull away. I need more practice with establishing kino, I know. But before her bus arrived, she brought out her phone and gave me her number. I didn\\'t even ask! \\n\\nSo all great. I\\'m 90% sure that this one won\\'t go anywhere, but this morning, I feel great having actually made an approach and it going that well. OK, maybe as she was on her own means it was approach on easy mode. But I was very much in the mindset that if she told me to sod off, I wouldn\\'t have cared. It\\'s practicing the approach that\\'s important. Plus, even if it does turn out as a mates thing, she\\'s actually pretty cool that I don\\'t mind that either. I have no friends now, so I\\'ll take whatever male or female!\\n\\nSmall point number 3. I\\'ve also been observing the no fap idea. I don\\'t know if it\\'s the working out, or the better diet, or generally things being so much better after that horrid fucking ltr, but I sure feel different. It\\'s sort of like realizing contact with another human body is just so much better than sitting in front of your PC with your nob in your hands. I think it certainly helps focus the mind a little more when talking to women and, if I can say, can sometimes make it easier to drop innuendo into the flow of a conversation. Make a girl giggle, that sort of thing. \\n\\nMore notably, I was really worried after my dead bedroom ltr that it had seriously damaged my ability to perform sexually. I felt zero desire at that point and even found that fapping had become difficult to actually get into. Some videos that were my long time favorites were just not getting me going anymore. That pretty much stung my confidence bigtime.\\n\\nWell, whatever changed that, it\\'s changed. Maybe the fapping ban did it, maybe the fact that I\\'m slowly realizing that I\\'m not some unfuckable luddite who will get rejected by every single girl in the world has helped, maybe it\\'s the fact that I\\'m actively doing something about my life, I\\'ve no idea. \\n\\nThe fact is, a month after, I\\'m hornier than a bull with another bull\\'s horns stapled to his existing horns, ready to give that asshole matador what-for next time he\\'s in that pen with him! That\\'s... pretty horny!\\n\\nSo I\\'m really glad I found the red pill - or more accurately someone handed it to me on a plate via one of my DB posts. It\\'s a primer for boosting your confidence, recovering your mindset and re-establishing yourself to yourself and re-affirming your masculinity. All I can say is read everything, read it with an open mind, take yourself back and be you. I know that sounds like a shitty employment-enforced mind training seminar, but TRP... saved my ass for sure!\\n\\nWhat was it I said? At least one cold approach a day? A challenge awaits: I need to go grocery shopping today!',\n",

That I could \"Love\" my prizes plate.\\n\\n\\nBoy that shit went down hill fast.\\n\\nI lost 2 years time and at least 7 solid pounds of muscle. Idk what I was thinking. Actually I know exactly what I was thinking and it\\'s insanity now that I look back at it.\\n\\nAt the end of it I found redpill and it re-solidified my upbringing  and I dropped that plate. Watching her fall to pieces was amazing.\\n\\nI have it on video when I served her the papers. #win\\n\\nBut I\\'m back at it. I travel a lot around the state and I now have at least one plate in each of my major stops.\\n\\nAfter this weekend I hope to have 2 more.\\n\\nSo thank you REDPILL for reaffirming everything I thought I forgot.\\n\\nI\\'m back bitches.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

But I honestly am thankful that it did, because I hung around. I had no idea what this subreddit was and I had seen it mentioned before when talking about subs that were most hated on here. \\n\\nWell since then I have begun to get the plates up on my sticks and the spinning is starting to happen. I had scheduled my first encounter this previous weekend but it fell through, got over it quickly and now have my first meet up again this coming Saturday (different girl). This is all since reading every last bit of info I could in the sidebar and in comments and threads. My electronic game text/fb/etc has gotten 10x stronger and I feel more confident when making decisions and speaking with the opposite sex. \\n\\nThis is the same cliche post, I've been nothing but a beta my whole life. My parents were divorced at a young age and I spent a lot of time with my mom. I always put women first, I would drop everything I am doing to get a small chance to hang out with them. Well I can truly say I feel like this is having a leg up on the competition. For once in my life I am happy with my decisions and with what I am doing with my life. That warm meat pocket that is located between those legs is just part of the ride and will always be plentiful. It should not control me and it should not make my decisions for me. \\n\\nSo with all that bullshit being said, a humble thank you for being here and having motivating information every single day. I look forward to seeing new posts every morning and racking my brain with new information. Thank you for existing and sharing your stories and experiences. I am grateful for finding this type of discussion while I am still relatively young, and while shocking I still feel it will be better for me to know in the long run. \",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So I was gonna write a FR for the main sub but will wait and see how this goes.\\n\\n-\\n\\nAnyways, me and some friends made plans to go to a gig last night. This meant the night was already starting differently than the usual binge-drinking. After some casual drinks and a massive joint before the concert we rolled in and started jamming on the dance floor. \\n\\nI would call myself a reasonably attractive male and last night I was constantly catching the eyes of the girls around me, glancing or gazing in my direction. After half an hour of grooving and a bit of confident grinding I locked eyes with one of my ex\\'s friends from across the d-floor. Shes about a HB7 who I\\'ve never talked to her before but she must\\'ve known that I\\'m high value because she has seen a couple of her friends swoon over me and she was giving me the eyes, a lot. I didn\\'t rush over to her but rather continued enjoying my night, and sure enough she had danced her way over to me in a few minutes. \\n\\nI was surprised by how little game I needed to put in with this girl because after grinding her for just 10-15 seconds she had turned around to lock her lips to my face. I didn\\'t even try and talk to her, we just communicated through body language. After 5 mins of hooking up the crowd was getting rowdy and we got knocked apart, not that it really mattered. I was just there for the great music.\\n\\nI think the speed with which I had pulled HB7 really got the crowd moist because soon after that I was getting butt squeezes from girls behind me. HB7 re-found me one more time to suck my face more, before me and my friends went outside for a smoke break.\\n\\nWhen we came back in my mates gf tapped me on the shoulder and pointed to her random friend, \"I think she wants to get with you\". Its  surprising how the girls come to you when you display a bit of desirability. When I was introduced to the frizzy haired hb6 she latched onto me and we danced for a minute or two. The only problem was that I saw the HB7 from before almost as soon as frizzy6 and I started grinding, and she was just a metre or two away. \\n\\nHB7 and her friends were now desperate for my attention and they tried to move to a row or two ahead of me so that they could dance hard and sleaze it up, but HB7 still only had eyes for me.\\n\\nSo HB7 ended up watching me grind the rest of the club for the last half hour of the gig. But I didn\\'t hook up with frizzy6 because I didn\\'t want to be a complete cunt to HB7, especially as now the stage is set for me to pull her another night in town.\\n\\nCompletely confirmed the redpill philosophy in my eyes, even though I have been a long term follower anyway.\\n\\n-\\n\\n**TL;DR**: *Hooked up with a HB7 after eye contact and 10 seconds of grinding, leave her to grind the rest of the club as she battled for my attention.*\\n\\n*Edit: Editing*',\n",

Felt it was more appropriate here.\\n\\n* **Childhood** I grew up an only child raised by my mother taking care of her every need. All my validation came from making sure that she was okay - and when I didn\\'t, shed punish me emotionally and reject me for a few days until I submitted and crawled back to her.\\n\\n* **The end of a 5 year LTR** It ended in October after a) she moved 1500 miles away to the west to become a vet b) our sex life had died 3 years earlier, c) I realized I loved and respected her, but never enjoyed her company. I didn\\'t know it then, but I was submissive and very blue pill, and she lost her sexual attraction. I broke it off and did a lot of meditating on life.\\n\\n* **Yesterday Afternoon** Was fucking awesome. Started the evening at 4pm having coffee with a coworker whom I adore, and spent the hour flirting and talking about our relationship. She\\'s a great woman, but has a lot of baggage from her past that make her prioritize her needs over others. I told her I just can\\'t be in that kind of relationship, and we \"agreed to disagree.\" I still love the woman, but we\\'re just not in a physical or relationship. **In the past, I would have done *anything* to have this woman call me her boyfriend**\\n\\n* **Yesterday evening** Went to the pool hall with my two friends, and had a fucking blast. The *last* thing on my mind was to pick up women. I rocked out to the music, slapped guys on the back, improvised a swing-dance to the beastie boys song \"Girls\" with a girl-friend of mine... Within an hour I had a beautiful blonde bombshell asking for my phone number.\\n\\nHer: Hey, I want to ask you out on a date.\\n\\nMe: Haha, what is this? I this high school?\\n\\nH: Your cute and I want your number.\\n\\nM: Give me your phone..\\n\\nH: No. I want *your* number. It\\'s a control thing.\\n\\nM: ::Grumble:: New age feminism....\\n\\nH: ::Smile, holding up her phone.:: Okay, what is it?\\n\\nM: (582) 999-9999\\n\\nH: Are you kidding me?\\n\\nM: ::I touch the sides of her abdomen, smiling:: Yeah... (we joke for a few minutes and I give her my number... she shows me her phone to verify, and I take it away and hit SEND. She tries to grab it before my phone rings, but is too late).\\n\\nH: (just as she\\'s about to walk away, she asks) What do you do?\\n\\nM: I wash ducks.\\n\\nH: You *wash* ducks?\\n\\nM: Yeah, the east coast has a TON of ducks that need cleaning during the winter time. The state hires me to clean them. My apartment is filthy.\\n\\nH: Do you use dawn?\\n\\nM: No way! That\\'s way too harsh. Baby shampoo is best.\\n\\nH: (Shes walking away backwards, smiling) I\\'ll call you.\\n\\nM: (She walks away, and I feel like she\\'s playing games with me. So I text her \"Games. All games\").\\n\\nH: (She comes back to check that we\\'re okay. We flirt and she leaves). \\n\\n\\n\\n----\\n\\nMoral of the story: I\\'m really fucking loving life. I love myself, my friends, and the women whom I\\'m attracted to. \\n\\nThanks RP!',\n",

I realised our relationship had gotten to the point where we were almost housemates. I started lifting again, quit smoking weed, getting up earlier and just being more aware of my actions; I was being somewhat beta without any alpha traits. I spoke with my SO about this and she has noticed a remarkable difference. I'm more decisive, dominant, and feel more manly; my confidence has shot through the roof. She's reciprocated by being more feminine and submissive which is a massive turn on. The sex has increased in quality and quantity too. Tomorrow I start boxing training. It's for a charity white collar fight with all proceeds going to a charity of my choosing. This put a huge smile on her face which surprised me, well she is going to see me fight, in a ring in front of hundreds of people. I've never boxed before, and in 10 weeks I step into the ring. I'm scared but that's why I signed up. I want to get out of my comfort zone, I want to face fears and I want to win! This sub gets a lot of hate which is completely unwarranted. This philosophy has changed my whole outlook on life. Still taking it as it comes, but I'm growing. Big up to all the red pillers. Here's to the future!\",\n",
