# Ideas for discussion w/Bertie

## Prelim RQ: 

- **How can we identify new parts of the manosphere?** (come up with a methodology to do so)

- -  **Related sub-questions**: who are the most active users? (/mods); what are the origins of sites? What are the boundaries of manosphere? (in this case, we look at Reddit as a case but we want it to be generalizable)
  - Will start with finding a broader definition of the manosphere --> will surface communities that belong to it (starting with the obvious and working in) --> will perform some NLP to understand user behaviour --> use info to explore how content / terminology spread

## Definition of the manosphere

### Our definition:

* Collection of misogynist / anti-feminist / men's rights communities and subcultures (Ging 2017) that use online spaces to discuss the state of masculinity, specifically how it is under attack by feminism
* "Core" Groups:
  * MRA
  * MGTOW
  * Incels
* Fringe groups:
  * PUA
  * Androphiles?
* Characteristics:
  * here, we're looking at online spaces so sidestep?
  * misogynist
  * Anti-feminist
  * alt-right? (is there a tension in the literature?)
    * if people are sitting in the middle, let's pull this out (i.e. where people are sidestepping)
* Distinctive features:
  * opposition to feminism (State of Hate, Ging)
  * sexist (PUAs - not core manosphere) vs misogynistic ("core")
*  Adjacent communities:
  * self-improvement angle to this -- do people start w/ self-improvement and then find themselves in manosphere?

# Questions: how much can we answer using previous lit?

* **Can we find evidence of alt-right? racist politics? gendered activities? outright misogyny?**
* **How much explicit misogyny is there against women?**
* **How positive is it (pro-men) vs. negative towards women?**
* Ideas:
  * Can we find overlap btwn subreddits (in topics discussed)?
    * or overlap btwn different harmful communities (racist, alt-right)?
      * Look at lit related to that
  * Does discourse vary by subreddit (do posters "code switch" by subreddit)?
  * Do moderators / superusers have different priorities than "average" poster?
  * How much do manosphere users bring that language to other places?
  * How do we distinguish btwn sexist and highly gendered and misogynist?
* Dates to bound reserach:
  * Data gap
    * Can't include data collection gap for anything properly time based
    * If not time based, can just be transparent and make sure it's not biasing the data
      * Robustness check -- are posts before and after similar? 
  * If we look at different communities, how do we map over time?
* **!!! Get more written up !!!** 

## Definitions of the manosphere from the literature

### Marwick (Data & Society):

* "The “manosphere” is a **loose collection of blogs and**
  **forums devoted to men’s rights, sexual strategy, and misogyny**. Both groups may use trolling tactics to draw attention to their causes, or may present themselves as more serious and scholarly."

### State of Hate (2019):

* “**manosphere**”: a loose collection of websites, forums, blogs and vlogs concerned with men’s issues and masculinity, oriented around an opposition to feminism and, within parts, the embrace of extreme misogyny."

### Van Valkenburgh (2018):

* "a loosely connected group of anti-feminist Internet communities comprised of phenomena as diverse as #gamergate, the alt-right, men’s rights activism, and pickup artist forums (Ging 2017; Schmitz & Kazyak 2016)"

### Ging (2017): 

* loose confederacy of anti-feminist / men's rights interest groups that  "have established complex connections with a myriad of interconnected organizations, blogs, forums, communities, and subcultures, resulting in a much more extreme and ostensibly amorphous set of discourses and ideological positions" (Nagle 2015)

### Ribeiro (2020):

* "a conglomerate of Web-based misogynist movements roughly focused on “men’s issues,” which has seen significant growth over the past years"
* "the Manosphere has emerged as a noteworthy conglomerate of “niche” communities, roughly aligned by their common interest in masculinity and its alleged crisis

### La Violette (2019):

* "a broad coalition of online masculinist groups united by strong anti-feminist positions (Ging 2017)"

### Jane (2017):

* "to refer to a ‘loose confederacy’ (Ging, 2017: 1) of hard-line men’s rights and interest communities online"
* "united by an antagonism towards women, a vehement opposition to feminism, and the production of **hyperbolic misogynist discourse involving the imagery of what Alex from A Clockwork Orange might call ‘ultraviolence’**"
* "The convergence of **subcultural trolling communities**, **ultra-ist men’s rights groups**, and **PUAs** into the franken-movement"
* Similarities between trolls, MRAs, PUAs:
  * origins pre-date cybersphere (i.e. respond to 2nd wave feminism)
  * "underdog outsider" identity (i.e. "anti-establishment, anti-Left, anti-moral conservative, anti-clerical, pro-libertarian")
  * "the conviction that **men have a right to sex with women**, and that **women derive power from exploiting men’s desires** by cynically ‘withholding’ physical intimacy for the purposes of manipulation."
  * produce rapeglish that is indescernable from one community to the other
  * **BUT there is some fluidity re: sexual preference which contradicts concepts of hegemonic masculinity** (Nagle 2016)

### Marwick (2018):

* "While the manosphere includes a variety of groups, including MRAs, pickup artists, MGTOW (men going their own way), incels (involuntary celibates), father’s rights activists, and so forth, they share a central belief that feminine values dominate society, that this fact is suppressed by feminists and “political correctness,” and that men must fight back against an overreaching, misandrist culture to protect their very existence (**Alice Marwick and Rebecca Lewis 2017**)."

### Gotell (2016):

* "the ‘**manosphere**,’ the cyber‐world of men’s rights that, as Robert Menzies has argued, unveils ‘a truly remarkable gallery of antifeminist content’"
* Groups: seems to exclusively refer to MRA in the article itself

### Farrell (2019):

* "The ‘manosphere’ is a group of **loosely incorporated websites and social media communities** where men’s perspectives, needs, gripes, frustrations and desires are explicitly explored."
* MRAs mentioned
* Linked to violent crimes and online harassment (GamerGate and TheFappening)

### Jones (2019):

* "digital manifestation of the **Men’s Liberation Movement**"
* Groups:
  * PUAs
  * Incels
  * father's groups
  * MRAs
  * MGTOW

### Ging (2020):

* "This amorphous network of online publics is noted for its **virulent anti-feminism**, **extreme misogyny** and **synergies with the alt-right**."
* "the rhetorical base of the new and **deeply misogynistic anti-feminist politics**, collectively known as the Manosphere, is typically located in the geekier and more extreme spaces of the Internet, such as 4/Chan (Manivannan, 2013; Nagle, 2015), Reddit (Massanari, 2017) and numerous men’s rights activist (MRA) and Red Pill sites such as Return of Kings (Mountford, 2018)"
* "Because the Manosphere is also centrally preoccupied with male sexual strategy (O’Neill, 2015), entitlement and disenfranchisement, issuing women with rape and death threats is a standard discursive tactic, a phenomenon described by Jane (2017) as ‘Rapeglish’."
* "**key discourses associated with the Manosphere** – **extreme** **misogyny** and **anti**-**feminism**, **hatred of gender studies** and **‘Cultural Marxism**’, **evolutionary psychology** and the **weaponization of hardcore pornography** (Ging, 2017)"



## Other useful musings on the manosphere

* Lilly (2016): (hypotheses about the manosphere)
  * "The discourse **maintains a traditional (oppositional) relationship to femininity and women**—the masculine construct excludes femininity and feminine traits;
  2. It mobilizes towards the past, embracing traditional gender roles and inequalities;
  3. The discourse emphasizes that masculinity is marked by control, privilege and entitlement—and that masculinity is therefore un- dermined by advancements made by women towards gender equality;
  4. Feminism is represented as being unnecessary, going too far, or being responsible for the unhappiness of men and women;
  5. The discourse appropriates the language of liberation and feminist/progressive tropes;
  6. It maintains a traditional understanding of masculinity vis-à-vis violence—that is to say that violence is represented as restorative of masculinity;
  7. Violence against women is reproduced in online contexts; 8. In online discourse, gender is represented through discursive styles such as flaming, and performances of masculinity online involve the rejection of feminine discursive and ethical norms;
  9. Gendertrolling/e-bile plays a key role in patrolling gender boundaries online and in an effort to keep women out of public spaces;
  10. In nerd cultures, an ambivalence towards hegemonic masculinity (because of its emphasis on high standards of heterosexuality) is articulated—but heterosexuality and whiteness remain key as- pects of the masculinity in these spaces.
  * The boundary between male and female, masculine and femi- nine, is vital to the maintenance of masculinity. Boundary maintenance can involve: 
    * a. the disparaging of femininity, the effeminate, or women (including put-downs, negative representations, or homo- phobia);
    * b. the naturalization of heterosexuality, including the use of sexualized and gendered epithets, the representation of gay men as not ‘real men’, and emphasis on the importance of heterosexual prowess;
  12. Masculinity is represented as being under constant siege by fem- inizing forces and in need of shoring-up;
  13. Whiteness is assumed or taken to be ‘default’; 14. A middle-class manhood is embraced—one that emphasizes self- sufficiency, independence, and bread-winner status;
  15. Working-class/blue collar masculinity is disparaged—men in this category are represented as ‘dumb brutes’ (celebrated for their physical virtues but imagined to be weak intellectually);
  16. Ideal masculinity is ablebodied—men are autonomous, in con- trol, independent, rational, stoic, and invulnerable. Ideal men are beautiful, healthy, normal, fit, competent, and intelligent."

## Methodology 

### General questions

* Difference between the manosphere itself and ideas / vocabulary *from the manosphere* used 
  * Is there a difference between the manosphere itself and its ideas? (e.g. vocab used in r/TRP like "cuck" or "beta" by gamer/geeks who don't ascribe to red pill beliefs)
  * Is there a difference beteween communities who describe themselves as part of the manosphere and those that don't (explicitly) but agree w/its beliefs (or further that use common logic)?
  * Poe's law may apply here (can't tell difference between ironic/non-ironic use of terms; intent doesn't matter if impact stands?)

### Ideas

* Checklist? or some kind of scoring matrix? (is this too subjective?)
  * i.e. references to red pill philosophy, especially misogyny & anti-feminist attacks, consistent use of vocabulary associated w/ red pill (see Reddit glossary page on r/theredpill or even references to women as "cumdumpsters, feminazis, femtard, cunts" as per Ging 2017)
  * Does explicit goal vs implicit effect matter here?
  * Maybe can propose different categories to how close a site may be to the "nucleus" which is itself made up of sites which are explicitly "red pill"/MRA/anti-feminist
* See the cross posting patterns (where are users cross posting? do by # of posts?)
* In lit (Lilly 2016) had seen CDA used but that seems really time intensive
