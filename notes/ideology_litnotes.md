* ideology = "actual political thinking"
* modern ideological analysis is divided by methodological practices, not "tight theoretical paradigms"
  * Looser groups, not "card carrying" groups of people
* Three ideological approaches:
  * Conceptual
    * ideologies as "systems of ideas" worth studying to understand their "ideational content"
    * unit for analysis: concepts (complex ideas that inject order and meaning into observed or anticipated sets of political phenomena and hold together an assotment of related notions)
  * Discursive
  * Quantitative
