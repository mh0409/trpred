“Mediated misogyny” (Vickery and Everbach (2018) and Mendes et al. (2019: 13)) - “to capture how this type of abuse can traverse both online and offline spheres”“While the manosphere includes a variety of groups, including MRAs, pickup artists, MGOW (men going their own way), incels (involuntary celibates), father’s rights activists, and so forth, they share a central belief that feminine values dominate society, that this fact is suppressed by feminists and “political correctness,” and that men must fight back against an overreaching, misandrist culture to protect their very existence (Alice Marwick and Rebecca Lewis 2017).“ (Marwick and Caplan, 2018)

Jane (2017) labels the discourse produced by the manosphere as ‘Rapeglish’, a useful way to bring “focus to the discursive components and functions of misogyny online”. These are terms that have been commonly used both within and outside of the manosphere, having made its way to “mainstream Internet spaces such [as] Urban Dictionary” (Ging 2017).These claims have been “heavily masculinized and geekified to give rise to a uniquely misogynist, heterosexist, and racist lexicon which includes terms such as cuck (a weak man whose girlfriend cheats on him, usually with black men), negging (giving backhanded compliments designed to undermine women’s confidence), friendzoning (sexually rejecting a man because he is a friend), going caveman (sexually dominating a woman), zero night stand (having sex without staying the night), shit testing ([expressing disingenuous disinterest]), the bitch shield (female defense against unwanted male attention), and pawning (using attractive women to demonstrate high SMV or sexual market value)” (Ging, 2017).

Additionally, Mountford (2018) used topic modelling to demonstrate that TRP interprets “innate female behaviour” as related to the terms ‘hypergamy’, ‘loyalty’, ‘selfishness’, and ‘denying’ and “the biological sex argument (‘biology’, ‘innate’, ‘biological’, ‘inherent’, and ‘evolutionary’)” are linked with ‘the relational negative sentiment term “inferior’“. In short, TRP sees women’s behavior as both negative, biologically determined, and as inferior to men’s behavior.

Farrell - “Finally, **we recognise that this is an observational study based on lexicons. An appropriate next step would be to explore the use of word embeddings or semantic concepts to better capture the context in which these terms are used. Data mining techniques, such as clustering, could also be used to identify linguistic patterns that may emerge from the data**. A study of influence in terms of users and messages for those communities, is also planned to explore the influence of language, how it spreads and from whom.”

Bowman-Grieve, 2009, p.990“The term **virtual community** therefore is used here as an anchor, an already formulated notion of shared online space and communicative interaction between users, about which one might make certain assumptions (i.e., that members chose to participate, that they are like-minded in some ways, sharing some similarities in points of view while also allowing space for discussion and debate, a community where ideas and knowledge are shared, information disseminated, and involved interaction between members encouraged).”

**Masculinity & EP**

* Masculinity is also used in conjunction with evolutionary psychology (discussed below) “to give rise to a uniquely misogynist, heterosexist, and racist lexicon which includes terms such as cuck (a weak man whose girlfriend cheats on him, usually with black men), negging (giving backhanded compliments designed to undermine women’s confidence), friendzoning (sexually rejecting a man because he is a friend), going caveman (sexually dominating a woman), zero night stand (having sex without staying the night), shit testing ([expressing disingenuous disinterest]), the bitch shield (female defense against unwanted male attention), and pawning (using attractive women to demonstrate high SMV or sexual market value)” (Ging, 2017).
