# Literature Notes

## Marwick & Lewis (Data & Society)

* Note to self: also look into papers/articles about Men's Right Activists (i.e. internet subculture)
* How do different "subcultures" make up the "manosphere"?
  *  What's the hierarchy? (Site / forum -> subculture -> bigger phenomenon (e.g. manosphere?))
  *  How does the alt-right fit into this?
     * "While such subcultures are diverse, they generally package themselves as anti-establishment in their reaction against multiculturalism and globalism, while promoting racist, anti-feminist, and anti-Semitic ideologies. We use the term “far- right” to characterize these players collectively, though many of these communities resist identification with the term."
  *  GOAL: to create definitions around the alt-right network and figure out who is involved, their motivations, and where they operate online
     * but they say: "by no means comprehensive, and the categories identified here are not always distinct from each other"
  *  NEOLOGISM = newly made / coined word 
  *  Difference between TACTICS and AGENDAS
  *  Organization of groups by BELIEFES (mens right activists) vs by MEDIA/PLATFORM (blog/podcast)

### Trolls

* Trolling = "asocial internet behaviours"; in 4chan /b/ users:
  * the use of deliberately offensive speech • Antipathy toward sensationalism in the mainstream media • The desire to create emotional impact in targets • The preservation of ambiguity (Poe’s Law: “Without a clear indication of the author’s intent, it is difficult or impossible to tell the difference between an expression of sincere extremism and a parody of extremism.”16
    )
  * "This enables trolls to maintain a quasi-moral argument that, by trolling, they are exposing the hypocrisy, ignorance, and stupid- ity of the mainstream media."
    * RedPillers think that people being offended by their views, they are successfully uncovering / proving themselves right -- those people have been brainwashed by the media; we are the ones who are seeing the "harsh truth"

### Gamergaters

* Gamers use RedPill vocab -- "betas"
* Gamergater = "shorthand for a particular kind of geek masculinity that feels victimized and disenfranchised by mainstream society, particularly popular feminism"
  * Use this strategy: "**Retrograde populism**. Gamergate participants asserted that feminism—and pro- gressive causes in general—are trying to stifle free speech, one of their most cher- ished values.30
    They are reacting to what they see as the domination of the world by global multiculturalism and the rise of popular feminism. This is a retrograde populist ideology which reacts violently to suggestions of white male privilege, is directly linked to the language of the Men’s Rights Movement, and is also present in the messaging of the alt-right."

### Hate groups and ideologues

* **DEFINITION OF MANOSPHERE!!**:

  *  "The “manosphere” is a loose collection of blogs and
     forums devoted to men’s rights, sexual strategy, and misogyny. Both groups may use trolling tactics to draw attention to their causes, or may present themselves as more serious and scholarly."
  *  Presented as similiar to alt-right bc they may use similar tactics or present themselves in a similar way
  *  "adopts liberal tropes of oppression to portray men as the victims of feminism gone too far"
  *  "The manosphere has existed online for decades, and has a well-developed set of rhetorical strategies that por- tray men—especially geeky or socially unsuccessful men—as victims of radical feminists."

* ### Alt-right

  * Rebranded white nationalism / white supremacy; purposefully vague 
  * Co-opted chan culture (80s scifi, Italo-disco synthpop music, "non-ironic nazism masquerading as ironic nazism") to appeal to millennials
  * **DEFINITION**- both a :
    * Trolling **culture** that "loathes establishment liberalism and conservatism embraces irony and in-jokes, and uses extreme speech to provoke anger in others."
    * "loosely affiliated **aggregation** of blogs, forums, podcasts, and Twitter personalities united by a hatred of liber- alism, feminism, and multiculturalism"

* ### MRAs

  * "MRAs attempt to prove the validity of their claims by furthering several frameworks and narratives, which have proven quite successful in promoting their cause and attracting new members. These nar- ratives include the idea that men and boys are victimized; that feminists in particu- lar are the perpetrators of such attacks; and that misinformation, political correct- ness, and the liberal agenda are used to hide the truth from the general public"

* **Radicalization** - 

  * "based on young men's dislike of "political correctness" to spread white supremacist thought, Islamophobia, and misogyny through irony and knowledge of internet culture"
  * "red pill" = radicalization
    * "To MRAs, being red-pilled means eschewing liberal ideology and recognizing that men, not women, are the oppressed class. To the alt-right, it means revealing the lies behind multiculturalism and globalism and accepting the truth of ethnonationalism."
    * "Red-pilling is the far-right equivalent to consciousness-raising or, in today’s lingo, becoming “woke.”"
  * Why is radicalization possible?
    * "Many chan users post about feeling unable to relate to mainstream culture, reflecting a sense of **anomie**. **Anomie**, as **Emile Durkheim** theorized, follows from rapid social change. This can lead to a mismatch between what society claims individuals can achieve and what is actually achiev- able, resulting in weakened group ties, a lack of adherence to social norms, frag- mentation of identity, and purposelessness."

### What techniques do media manipulators use?

* "Thus, there is a low barrier to entry, and various forms of “legitimate peripheral participation” exist in which curious onlookers can slowly learn group norms and become accepted contributors."
  * reminds me of r/theredpill rules
* ""“Cuck” suggests being a willful participant in one’s own undoing due to adopting a supposedly corrupted value system; it is a more specific variant of “sheeple” (blending of sheep and people) or “lemming.” “Cuck” originates in racial cuckold porn, in which white men are willingly humiliated by inviting black men to have sex with their white wives while they watch. Thus, the word “cuck” is intrinsically linked with white supremacist ideology and serves as a dog whistle to those on the far-right"

## State of Hate 2019

* definition of **manosphere**:
  * "One influence on the contemporary far right’s understanding of gender politics is the “**manosphere**”: a loose collection of websites, forums, blogs and vlogs concerned with men’s issues and masculinity, oriented around an opposition to feminism and, within parts, the embrace of extreme misogyny."

## Van Valkenburgh - "Digesting the Red Pill"

* Definition of **manosphere**:
  * "a loosely connected group of anti-feminist Internet communities comprised of phenomena as diverse as #gamergate, the alt-right, men’s rights acti- vism, and pickup artist forums (Ging 2017; Schmitz & Kazyak 2016)"

## Ging - "Alphas, Betas, and Incels: Theorizing the Masculinities of the Manosphere"

* definition of manosphere:
  * loose confederacy of anti-feminist interest groups that have "have established complex connections with a myriad of interconnected organizations, blogs, forums, communities, and subcultures, resulting in a much more extreme and ostensibly amorphous set of discourses and ideological positions" (Nagle 2015)
    * MRAs
    * MGTOW
    * PUA
    * Traditional Christian Conservatives (TradCons)
    * Gamer/geek culture (only a subsection)
* "the **manosphere** has since received considerable media attention, most nota- bly for its **extreme misogyny** and **association with high-profile, off-line events**; from the Isla Vista and Oregon **mass shootings** (Garkey 2014; Dewey 2014; Williams 2015; Chemaly 2015) and **cases of college campus rape** to the sustained **abuse and death threats directed at female gamers and journalists** that culminated in Gamergate."
* "Central to the politics ofthe manosphere is the concept of **the Red Pill**, an analogy which derives from the 1999 film The Matrix [...] The Red Pill philosophy purports to **awaken men to feminism’s misandry and brainwashing, and is the key concept that unites all of these communities**."

## Ribero et al. - "The Evolution of the Manosphere Across the Web"

* Goal: characterize manosphere using Reddit subreddits + 4chan /pol/; find that users are moving from "milder" communities (PUA) to more extremist ones (MGTOW)
* Definition of **manosphere**:
  * "a conglomerate of Web-based misogynist movements roughly focused on “men’s issues,” which has seen sig- nificant growth over the past years"
  * "the Manosphere has emerged as a noteworthy conglomerate of “niche” communities, roughly aligned by their common interest in masculinity and its al- leged crisis [32]."
    * Examples: PUAs, MRAs, MGTOW, Incels
  * Manosphere as originating in the Men's Liberation Movement in the 60s and 70s and then moving onto the web
* **RQ1**: How has the popularity/levels of activity of the different Manosphere communities evolved over time?
  **RQ2**: Has there been substantial migration of, or intersection in, users across communities?
  **RQ3**: Has speech become more toxic and/or misogynistic over time?

## Lilly - 'The World is Not a Safe Place for Men': The Representational Politics of the Manosphere

* Definition of manosphere:
  * MRA, MGTOW, PUA, Incels
    * "MRA + MGTOW see the crisis in masculinity in society which is increasingly feminized" - Ribeiro
    * "PUA and incels see crisis in men themselves" - Ribeiro
  * Key ideas:
    * masculinity is under siege by feminizing forces
    * feminism is hypocritical as it is oppressive

## La Violette (2019) - Using Platform Signals for Distinguishing Discourses

* Uses reddit comment scores as "platform effects" (Malik and Pfeffer 2016)
  * Could "platform effects" be used to describe the effect of moderators?
* Paper seeks to prove how comment scores "are an essential organizing principle for the proliferation of content...and also a menas of **distinguishing subreddits as distinct ideological communities**"
  * In r/TRP, the flair does this more so than comment scores alone (or comment scores would *beget* a piece of flair)
* Uses **CDA**, arguing that it
  * 1) is oriented towards **textual** analysis
  * 2) already considers certain quantitative aspects
* **Definition of manosphere**:
  * "a broad coalition of online masculinist groups united by strong anti-feminist positions (Ging 2017)"
* Feminist HCI = "human-computer interaction"
* Dig at PMI (pointwise mutual information):
  * Rather than sampling comments based on an extrinsic measure–for example, point-wise mutual information (Recchia and Jones 2009)–or using the entire dataset, a focus on platform signals generated by the community ensure that sampling is representative of the norms of the subreddit’s ideology.

## Jane (2018) - Systemic misogyny exposed: Translating Rapeglish from the Manosphere witha Random Rape Threat Generator

* Summary: 'Rapeglish' is so common and distinctive that it's essentially become it's own language. The author frames a random rape threat generator as a way women are responding to (and with) Rapeglish by "appropriating and subverting the original discourse"

* **Definition of the manosphere**:

  * "to refer to a ‘loose confederacy’ (Ging, 2017: 1) of hard-line men’s rights and interest communities online"
  * "united by an antagonism towards women, a vehement opposition to feminism, and the production of **hyperbolic misogynist discourse involving the imagery of what Alex from A Clockwork Orange might call ‘ultraviolence’**"
    * this ^^ discourse is "**rapeglish**"
  * "The convergence of **subcultural trolling communities**, **ultra-ist men’s rights groups**, and **PUAs** into the franken-movement"
  * Father of the men's right movement: **Paul Elam**
    * "His argument is tha**t masculine failures and disappointments are not the fault of individual men but have come about as a result of ‘institutionalized feminism’**, a family court system ‘rigged against dutiful fathers’, and a world gripped by **misandry**"
  * On PUAs being part of the manosphere:
    * "PUAs **share the previous two groups’ conspiracy-minded thinking about the reach and agenda of feminism**. For instance, Valizadeh has called feminism a ‘war against men’, warning that, ‘Those who don’t pick up arms … will suffer most’ (cited in Broomfield, 2016)"
  * Similarities between trolls, MRAs, PUAs:
    * origins pre-date cybersphere (i.e. respond to 2nd wave feminism)
    * "underdog outsider" identity (i.e. "anti-establishment, anti-Left, anti-moral conservative, anti-clerical, pro-libertarian")
    * "the conviction that **men have a right to sex with women**, and that **women derive power from exploiting men’s desires** by cynically ‘withholding’ physical intimacy for the purposes of manipulation."
    * produce rapeglish that is indescernable from one community to the other
    * BUT there is some fluidity re: sexual preference which contradicts concepts of hegemonic masculinity (Nagle 2016)
  * "Birth" of the manosphere:
    * "It is impossible to designate the precise moment the Manosphere – as identified by social observers and commentators such as those at Know Your Meme and the SPLC – moved from the peripheries of cyber culture to a more core location. My research on the history of misogyny online, however, indicates there was a clear tipping point around 2010 (Jane, 2017b: 22–8) – likely related to the advent of the Web 2.07 era and the uptake of social media, in conjunction with enduring systemic misogyny (as evidenced by the fact that men continue to hold a disproportionate share of political, economic, and social power, with some using various forms of violence against women to maintain the ineq- uitable status quo [Jane, 2017b: 43–4])."

## Marwick (2018) - Drinking male tears: language, the manosphere, and networked harassment

* Summary: Use CDA to examine the term "misandry" and how it's made its way into the mainstream, analyzing its ideological and community-building functions. Ultimately, it reinforces the misogynistic ontology that "paints feminism as a man-hating movement which victimizes men and boys"
* Definition of the manosphere:
  * "While the manosphere includes a variety of groups, including MRAs, pickup artists, MGTOW (men going their own way), incels (involuntary celibates), father’s rights activists, and so forth, they share a central belief that feminine values dominate society, that this fact is suppressed by feminists and “political correctness,” and that men must fight back against an overreaching, misandrist culture to protect their very existence (**Alice Marwick and Rebecca Lewis 2017**)."

## Gotell (2016) - Sexual violence in the 'manosphere'

* Summary: Use discourse analysis on several popular MRA websites. "We argue that sexual violence is emerging as a new focus of the men’s rights movement, competing with a longstanding emphasis on fathers’ rights."
* Definition of the **manosphere**:
  * "the ‘**manosphere**,’ the cyber‐world of men’s rights that, as Robert Menzies has argued, unveils ‘a truly remarkable gallery of antifeminist content’"
  * Groups: seems to exclusively refer to MRA in the article itself

## Farrell (2019) - Exploring misogyny across the manosphere in Reddit

* Summary: Study the flow of extreme language across communities on Reddit, investigating if and how ideas spread within and between them. Create nine "specific misogynistic" lexicons.
* Findings: There is increasingly misogynistic content / violence / hostility in the communities examined.
* Definition of the **manosphere**:
  * "The ‘manosphere’ is a group of **loosely incorporated websites and social media communities** where men’s perspectives, needs, gripes, frustrations and desires are explicitly explored."
  * MRAs mentioned
  * Linked to violent crimes and online harassment (GamerGate and TheFappening)

## Jones (2019) - Sluts and soyboys: MGTOW and the production of misogynistic online harassment

* Summary: Use content / thematic analysis to show how MGTOW ideology / rhetoric  "propogates and normalises misogynistic beliefs through online harassment." 
* Findings: MGTOW are distinct from Incels / MRAs / other "red pillers". There is a link to MGTOW and toxic masculinity; their appeals to rational thinking make it seem like common sense.
* Definition of the **manosphere**:
  * "digital manifestation of the **Men’s Liberation Movement**"
  * Groups:
    * PUAs
    * Incels
    * father's groups
    * MRAs
    * MGTOW

## Ging (2020) - Neologising misogyny: Urban Dictionary's folksonomies of sexual abuse

* Summary:
* Definition of manosphere:
  * "This amorphous network of online publics is noted for its virulent anti-feminism, extreme misogyny and synergies with the alt-right."
  * "the rhetorical base of the new and **deeply misogynistic anti-feminist politics**, collectively known as the Manosphere, is typically located in the geekier and more extreme spaces of the Internet, such as 4/Chan (Manivannan, 2013; Nagle, 2015), Reddit (Massanari, 2017) and numerous men’s rights activist (MRA) and Red Pill sites such as Return of Kings (Mountford, 2018)"
  * "Because the Manosphere is also centrally preoccupied with male sexual strategy (O’Neill, 2015), entitlement and disenfranchisement, issuing women with rape and death threats is a standard discursive tactic, a phenomenon described by Jane (2017) as ‘Rapeglish’."
  * "**key discourses associated with the Manosphere** – **extreme** **misogyny** and **anti**-**feminism**, **hatred of gender studies** and **‘Cultural Marxism**’, **evolutionary psychology** and the **weaponization of hardcore pornography** (Ging, 2017)"

## Southern Law Poverty Center (2012):

* Definition of the manosphere:
  * "The so-called “manosphere” is peopled with hundreds of websites, blogs and forums dedicated to savaging feminists in particular and women, very typically American women, in general. Although some of the sites make an attempt at civility and try to back their arguments with facts, they are almost all thick with misogynistic attacks that can be astounding for the guttural hatred they express. What follows are brief descriptions of a dozen of these sites. Another resource is the Man Boobz website (manboobz.com), a humorous pro-feminist blog (its tagline is “Misogyny: I Mock It”) that keeps a close eye on these and many other woman-hating sites."

## Kate Manne - Down Girl

* "What I’ve aimed to do in the first part of the book is to construct what you can envisage as a sort of conceptual skeleton: a general framework which understands misogyny in terms of what it *does* to women. **Namely, I argue that we should think of misogyny as serving to uphold patriarchal order, understood as one strand among various similar systems of domination (including racisms, xenophobia, classism, ageism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, and so on)**. Misogyny does this by visiting hostile or adverse social consequences on a certain (more or less circumscribed) class of girls or women to enforce and police social norms that are gendered either in theory (i.e., content) or in practice (i.e., norm enforcement mechanisms).

  Notice what this claim says and what it doesn’t: both the content of the norms themselves and the mechanisms of enforcement may vary widely, depending on the overall social position of differently situated girls and women. This may also have an important effect on either the experience or impact of misogyny, given forms of disadvantage or vulnerability that may be mutually compounding. I take this to be one of the key lessons of the method and approach to political thought known as intersectionality, pioneered by Kimberlé W. Crenshaw ([1991](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190604981.001.0001/oso-9780190604981-bibliography-1#oso-9780190604981-bibItem-56); [1993](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190604981.001.0001/oso-9780190604981-bibliography-1#oso-9780190604981-bibItem-57); [1997](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190604981.001.0001/oso-9780190604981-bibliography-1#oso-9780190604981-bibItem-58); [2012](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190604981.001.0001/oso-9780190604981-bibliography-1#oso-9780190604981-bibItem-59)). In chapter [2](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190604981.001.0001/oso-9780190604981-chapter-3#), I’ll say more about how my ameliorative analysis explicitly builds in space for these insights." (p.13)

* "we should instead understand **misogyny as primarily a property of social environments in which women are liable to encounter hostility due to the enforcement and policing of patriarchal norms and expectations—often, though not exclusively, insofar as they violate patriarchal law and order.** Misogyny hence functions to enforce and police women’s subordination and to uphold male dominance, against the backdrop of other intersecting systems of oppression and vulnerability, dominance and disadvantage, as well as disparate material resources, enabling and constraining social structures, institutions, bureaucratic mechanisms, and so on." (p.19)
* "Notice then that on my proposed analysis **misogyny’s essence lies in its social function, not its psychological nature**. To its agents, misogyny need not have any distinctive “feel” or phenomenology from the inside. If it feels like anything at all, it will tend to be *righteous*: like standing up for oneself or for morality, or—often combining the two—for the “little guy.” It often feels to those in its grip like a moral crusade, not a witch hunt. And it may pursue its targets not in the spirit of hating women but, rather, of loving justice. It can also be a purely *structural* phenomenon, instantiated via norms, practices, institutions, and other social structures." (p.20)
* "**Misogyny *is* then what misogyny *does* to some such, often so as to preempt or control the behavior of others**. Misogyny takes a girl or a woman belonging to a specific social class (of a more or less fully specified kind, based on race, class, age, body type, disability, sexuality, being cis/trans, etc.). It then threatens hostile consequences if she violates or challenges the relevant norms or expectations as a member of this gendered class of persons. These norms include (supposed) entitlements on his part and obligations on hers. She may also be positioned as the *type* of woman who is representative of those who are not playing their assigned parts properly or are trespassing on his territory." (p.20)
* "I propose taking **sexism to be the branch of patriarchal ideology that *justifies* and *rationalizes* a patriarchal social order, and misogyny as the system that *polices* and *enforces* its governing norms and expectations. So sexism is scientific; misogyny is moralistic**. And a patriarchal order has a hegemonic quality." (p.20)
* "sexism should be understood primarily as the “justificatory” branch of a patriarchal order, which consists in ideology that has the overall function of rationalizing and justifying patriarchal social relations." (p. 79)
* "So sexist ideology will often consist in assumptions, beliefs, theories, stereotypes, and broader cultural narratives that represent men and women as importantly different in ways that, if true and known to be true, or at least likely, would make rational people more inclined to support and participate in patriarchal social arrangements. Sexist ideology will also encompass *valorizing* portrayals of patriarchal social arrangements as more desirable and less fraught, disappointing, or frustrating than they may be in reality. Whereas, **as I’ve defined misogyny, it functions to *police* and *enforce* a patriarchal social order without necessarily going via the intermediary of people’s assumptions, beliefs, theories, values, and so on.** Misogyny serves to enact or bring about patriarchal social relations in ways that may be direct, and more or less coercive." (p.79)

* "On this picture, **sexist ideology will tend to discriminate *between* men and women, typically by alleging sex differences beyond what is known or could be known, and sometimes counter to our best current (p.80) scientific evidence**. **Misogyny will typically differentiate between good women and *bad* ones, and punishes the latter**. Overall, sexism and misogyny share a common purpose—to maintain or restore a patriarchal social order. But sexism purports to merely be being reasonable; misogyny gets nasty and tries to force the issue. Sexism is hence to bad science as misogyny is to moralism. Sexism wears a lab coat; misogyny goes on witch hunts." (p.80)

## Louise Richardson-Self - 

* "What is particular to misogyny, alongside the presence of hostility, is that it func-tions coercively."
* "However, as mentioned above, patriarchy does not rely on misogyny only in order to perpetuate itself. It functions symbiotically with sexism, which “often works by naturalizing sex differences, in order to justify patriarchal social arrange- ments, by making them seem inevitable, or portraying people trying to resist them as fighting a losing battle”
* "Furthermore, to Manne, the term sexism does not connote hostility what- soever (78). However, she does acknowledge that sexism “may be used in service of misogynist ends in practice” (80), but to do so successfully would result in sexism’s counting as misogynistic—that is, the practice would be transformational."

## Hypermasculinity

*Some general articles on hypermasculinity, might be worth a look*

[Performing Hypermasculinity](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1097184X15595083)

[Hypermasculinity & Dickwolves: The Contentious Role of Women in the New Gaming Public](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08838151.2012.705199)

[Losing Visibility? The Rise and Fall of Hypermasculinity in Science…](https://journals.openedition.org/inmedia/491?lang=en)

* Jones, 2019
  * Defining toxic masculin- ity, Kupers (2005: 713–714) states that it is the ‘constellation of socially regressive male traits that serve to foster domination, the devaluation of women, homophobia and wanton violence’ and are, ultimately, ‘socially destructive’. In this way, toxic masculinity is a result of championing these negative, **hypermasculine** traits, to the point that they become the idealised and desirable masculine identity
* Massanari, 2015
  * “However, it both repudiates and reifies elements of hegemonic masculinity (Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005). For example, geek masculinity often embraces fac- ets of **hypermasculinity** by valorizing intellect over social or emotional intelligence. At the same time, geek masculinity rejects other hypermasculine traits, as “the geek” may show little interest in physical sports and may also demonstrate awkwardness regarding sexual/romantic relationships (Kendall, 2011).”
* Ging, 2017
  * Connell and Messerschmidt (2005) have pointed out, geek masculinity “both repudi- ates and reifies elements of hegemonic masculinity.” According to Kendall (2011), geek males embrace some aspects of **hypermasculinity**, such as the valorizing of intellect over emotion, but do not comply with others, such as sexual and sporting prowess. Therefore, although they are white, male and possess significant cultural capital, they perceive themselves as marginalized. According to Massanari (2015), this makes geek males less able or willing to recognize their own privilege
  * Thus, while they may reject the conventional signifiers of more traditional var-iants ofhegemonic masculinity, such as homophobia, physical prowess, and wealth-based status, it appears that these men are no less invested in achieving hegemony over women than their jock predecessors.
* Shooting
* Camping
* Weight lifting
* Fast cars
* *Aspirational or actual? Is it something they do or that they feel threatened by? Or that they just aren’t interested in?*

## Homophobia

* Ging, 2017:
  * Contradictory discourses around homosexuality within the manosphere. Gamers, red pillers, and MRAs can be gay positive. In fact, “positivity functions here to unite white, middle-class men, irrespective of sexual orientation, against feminism and other forms of “political correctness” that are perceived as threats to freedom of expression and, ultimately, to their social privilege. The ideological machinations of the manosphere serve as a stark demonstration, therefore, of how reduced homohysteria can happily coexist with extreme expressions of misogyny and racism, indicating that inclusive masculinity theory’s concept of inclusivity is limited to white, middle-class men” (Ging, 2017)
  * In a recent article on the beta uprising, Nagle (2016) rejects the view of the “social media–centric feminist commentariat” that beta masculinity is “just another emanation of hegemonic masculinity,” arguing that to theorize these masculinities as patriarchal is incompatible with their acceptance of “gender-bending pornogra- phy, discussions about bisexual curiosity, and a male My Little Pony fandom
  * Thus, while they may reject the conventional signifiers of more traditional variants of hegemonic masculinity, such as homophobia, physical prowess, and wealth-based status, it appears that these men are no less invested in achieving hegemonyover women than their jock predecessors.

* Jones et al., 2019:
* “Homophobia and transphobia were also used as ways to police the boundaries of hegemonic masculinity and enforce heterosexuality as the only acceptable form of mas- culine sexuality” within the MGTOW community.“While MGTOWs reject relationships with women, they must perform their heterosexuality in other ways. Thus, the performance of a heterosexual hegemonic masculinity is often expressed as a rejection of homosexuality. The basis of a repudiation of homosexuality remains its equation with femininity; hence, its rejection is a way of policing the borders of hegemonic masculinity and a way of maintaining and reinforcing masculinised power”Farrell et al., 2019Records homophobia across manosphere subreddits within Reddit using a lexicon approach, finding that it is present across all the communities observed.Mountford, 2018:“Degeneracy” is linked to progressive politics and “homosexuality”, showing that hegemonic masculine homophobia as identified by Connell and Messerschmidt (2005) is still present in TRP’s neomasculinity.
* Lilly:
  * “Sexual orientation—heterosexuality—is another vitally important axis of traditional constructs of masculinity. As was introduced briefly above, compulsory heterosexuality stems from masculinity’s oppo- sition to femininity and the effeminate. Sexualized and gendered epi- thets link male homosexuality to femininity”
  * Variation per community:“MRM was framed as an ally to gay rights groups and gay men in par- ticular. One post for instance mentions that straight men are not the only male victims of intimate partner violence—gay men and transgender men can be victims too (AVFM, 2013c)”. Though others in the MRM community may repudiate gay men by saying that they get “special treatment” and denying that homophobia (as well as the patriarchy and sexism against women) exists (Nagle, 2015; p. 113).“The hypothesis that homosexuality is disparaged in the discourseis supported. The PUA community, and MRA Janet Bloomfield, both speak in disparaging terms about homosexuality. Bloomfield maintains that gay people are privileged and that homophobia no longer exists. The PUA community reproduces traditional homophobic rep- resentations of gay men—who are depicted as different and dangerous”
  * PUA community as homophobic. Quoting Roosh V (“I don’t care what gay people do in private, but it annoys me to be surrounded by their flamboyant, deviant, and abnormal behaviour in public, especial- ly with their excessive displays of affection,” (RV, 2013d)”), Nagle argues that homosexuality is frame as deviant and abnormal. “PUA discourse denies the existence of homophobia; instead, the culture is one of heterophobia. One ROK contributor writes that ‘America is becoming a homosexual nation,’ (ROK, 2013e). Roosh V argues that the ‘heterophobic’ culture in the West means that “[p]romoting a heterosexual or traditional family lifestyle is becoming increasingly shamed while criticism of homo- sexual lifestyle is no longer allowed,” and that “we’re only 10-15 years away from when homosexuality or bisexuality will be seen as a superior lifestyle to heterosexuality,” (RV, 2013c). Roosh also argues that sexual orientation is a choice: homosexuality is a ‘lifestyle with no genetic basis’: “yes, I am saying that gayness is not 100 [percent] biological—there is absolutely an environmental component … A genetically straight man could be turned gay if raised in an environ- ment that nurtures and encourages his slightest homosexual tenden- cies, which is what America is doing today,” (RV, 2013c).”

## **Transphobia**

### Nagle

Found evidence of homophobia and transphobia in 4chan/b/

### Lilly, 2015

* MRA as tolerating transgender people in a bid to position itself as inclusive and intersectional movement that seeks to protect the interest of and “‘tokenize’ racialized, gay, (dis)abled, and trans people in order to posi- tion the MRM as an inclusive and intersectional movement, and rep- resent feminism as working against the interests of these groups”
* PUA community observed by Nagle (Return of Kings website) describes transgender women, in particular as “freaks” when mentioned, but notes that trans persons are mostly invisible in the discourse (when not being denigrated).

### Jones

* “Homophobia and transphobia were also used as ways to police the boundaries of hegemonic masculinity and enforce heterosexuality as the only acceptable form of mas- culine sexuality.”Implies that cisgender is the ideal in hegemonic masculinity

## **Racism / nativism / ethnocentricity**

### Lilly, 2015

* “Rarely does the discourse speak implicitly or explicitly about race—12.5 percent of MRA cases and 6.3 percent of PUA cases included some discus- sion on the topic.”
* MRA - “Feminism is characterized as inherently racist, and responsible for injustices in the lives of black men and women.”
* PUA
  * “In PUA discourse, conversely, problematic stereotypical/colonial representations are evident—racialized men are characterized as primitive/uncivilized and irrational.”

### Farrell

* Find evidence of racism using a lexicon-based approach.

### Dutton and Gotell

* “Interestingly, in more recent activism, MRAs have begun to deploy progressive anti‐racist rhetoric to bolster arguments about false accusations. Drawing on a longstanding history of racist rape allegations against black men, accusations against American entertainer Bill Cosby have been presented on AVFM as ‘high tech lynching’ (Ali 2015). While incorrectly deployed, this acknowledgement of structural racism stands out against the essentialist and gender‐binarized framework that dominates the MRA discourse and that constructs men as a group as being under threat from feminists.”
