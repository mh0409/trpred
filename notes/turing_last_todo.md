* Need comparison data!

  * Do we want to compare different type of sexist communities? 
    * This would be theoretically driven
      * If we do this (look at pro-women spaces), it would change the research
  * Or do we want something random? (equivalent in size / number of users?)
    * Randomly sample from all subreddits? or quasi sample from top 20 most active subreddits on reddit
      * Non-theory driven approach
    * **LET'S USE RANDOM SAMPLE FOR NOW**

* Put table for black pill / blue pill / purple pill / black pill

  * Definition of each

* See if we can scrape / pull banned subreddits

* Add counts to sheet1 (from counts by subreddit)

* **Time limit**: up to quarantine (let's go with this for now)

  * Identify lower boundary (maybe beginning of r/TRP?)

* Put my availability / plans at top of "manosphere" document

* Focus on section 1 in next week

  * Get list / Collect data for known subreddits
  * Generate summary stats
    * Commnts / posts per user
    * Unique # of users per subreddit

* Finish scraping

  * Got status code 520 when scraping men's rights? Look into this
  *
