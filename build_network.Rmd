### found a way to separate things out a bit more in SO but not exactly sure how it does so....leaving it here for now
### Basically, the function adds an extra vertex that is connected to all vertices belonging to the same community. The layout is calculated based on the new graph. Since each community is now connected by a common vertex, they tend to cluster together.
