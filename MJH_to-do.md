# trp.red project to-do list

1. Finish data collection + validation for r/TRP 

2. - Validation: do check of comments as time series, make sure there's full coverage, etc.

   - Subtask: collect data from related subreddits (use for related subreddits TBD) ***if feasible / easy w/ current code\***
